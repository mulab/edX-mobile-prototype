  <b>Abstract</b><br>
Software as a Service (SaaS) and Agile software development started simultaneously but independently. SaaS deploys software at one site made available over the Internet. Agile relies on incrementally developed prototypes and continuous customer feedback. Since Agile embraces change, it is an excellent match to SaaS’s rapid evolution. Thus, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google...rely on Agile.
