<h3>ACM Webcast with David Patterson and Armando Fox, May 8: "Engineering Software as a Service"</h3>


<p>
<a href="http://w.on24.com/r.htm?e=603738&s=1&k=BC1B5DF4A564713A7E602907290BC850">Register TODAY</a> to attend the next complimentary ACM Webcast, "Engineering Software as a Service," presented on Wednesday, May 8, 2013, at 2 PM ET (1 pm CT/12 noon MT/11 AM PT/6 PM GMT). 
  
  <br>Join David Patterson, Director of the Parallel Computing Lab (ParLab) at UC-Berkeley (and a former ACM president) in a special virtual event moderated by his ParLab colleague Armando Fox. The talk will be followed by a live question and answer session. (If you'd like to attend but can't make it to the virtual event, you still need to register to receive a recording of the webinar when it becomes available.)

(Note: You can stream this and all ACM Learning Webinars on your mobile device, including smartphones and tablets.)

<p>
  <b>Abstract</b><br>
Software as a Service (SaaS) and Agile software development started simultaneously but independently. SaaS deploys software at one site made available over the Internet. Agile relies on incrementally developed prototypes and continuous customer feedback. Since Agile embraces change, it is an excellent match to SaaS’s rapid evolution. Thus, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google...rely on Agile.
</p>
  


<p>
  <b>What You'll Learn About</b><br>
The synergy between SaaS, Agile, and modern frameworks like Ruby on Rails and modern tools like Cucumber, RSpec, and Pivotal Track.
Eliciting SaaS requirements from customers via User Stories.
Following Behavior-Driven Design to convert SaaS User Stories into acceptance tests using Cucumber.
Following Test-Driven Design to transform SaaS acceptance tests into unit tests using RSpec.
Projecting SaaS app costs and schedule via Velocity using Pivotal Tracker.
Organizing SaaS programming teams by following Scrum principles.
This talk is based on Massive Open Online Courses from UC Berkeley, offered in partnership with EdX (CS169.1x and CS169.2x), and a related textbook.

</p></li><li><h2>March 19, 2013</h2><section class="update-description"><ul><li><p> Welcome to CS169.1x: Software Engineering for Software as a Service! </p><br><p>You can check out the 
<a href="https://edge.edx.org/courses/BerkeleyX/CS169.1x/2013_Spring_Tsinghua/syllabus/">syllabus page</a> 
to see the topics we’ll be covering. You will learn the principles of software engineering by developing software to be deployed as a service in the cloud. Rather than just advise on good practices, this course offers software tools to put each of those practices to work. There will be lecture videos and homework assignments or programming assignments nearly every week, and quizzes every two weeks. <br></p><p>
The course information page has information about course logistics and policies. Our primary communication channel will be our interactive forum, where we’ll all contribute to an ongoing discussion of the material. <br></p><p>There are a couple videos for you to watch on the courseware page: an official welcome to the course by us and tutorial videos walking you through the edX platform. The first lecture segments will be available for you to watch on Monday. In these introductory segments, we give the history of software (including some infamous disasters) and how it led to the Agile software development method, which we teach and which many SaaS companies use.
</p><p>We will post a mini-quiz, Quiz 0, that will serve as a course self-diagnostic so you can verify your programming preparedness for the course as well as your understanding of the goals of this course.<br></p><p>We look forward to participating in a grand learning experiment with you!
