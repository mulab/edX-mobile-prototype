<h1>Homework 2: Performance</h1><h3>Due Sunday, December 16th (No late submissions accepted)</h3><p>
  In this assignment you will improve the database performance and scaling of a version of the Rotten Potatoes app. Lecture 12 will be very helpful for this assignment. There are two parts to this assignment:
  <ol><li> Database Performance (100 points): In this part you will create a migration that improves the performance of two queries, it involves a small amount of coding.</li><li> Caching (100 points): This section involves answering three multiple choice questions about caching in rails, it involves no coding. You will have unlimited attempts to answer the questions.</li></ol> There is
  a very short timeframe to complete this assignment, so we encourage you to start as soon as possible, if you find yourself running out of time, try to at least complete part 2 as it takes significantly less time than part 1. This is the first
  time that this assignment has been run and your feedback is greatly appreciated.
