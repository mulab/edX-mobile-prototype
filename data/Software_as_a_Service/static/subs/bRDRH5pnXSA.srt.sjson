    "SOLOM HEDDAYA: So one of the big changes for me personally as I moved", 
    "from Windows to Bing, where this thing is-- even though we serve all of", 
    "Microsoft, we are housed in Bing--", 
    "is that Bing uses agile development methodology.", 
    "So it focuses--", 
    "as I'm sure I looked at the table of contents and the syllabus for the", 
    "course and I saw that you covered some of these topics already.", 
    "So it focuses on getting something out fast.", 
    "And that it's a--", 
    "what you could use is a functionally cohesive slice of the product.", 
    "Maybe it's a feature.", 
    "It's something that is meaningful to the user.", 
    "The idea is that you get out fast.", 
    "You figure out if people really care about it.", 
    "And you fail quickly if they tell you wait, this is not what we wanted.", 
    "Or they tell you, wow, this is great, keep going.", 
    "Then you get this very positive feedback very fast.", 
    "The key problem with agility for us is that we are not just a platform in", 
    "Microsoft lingo.", 
    "You're familiar with Google lingo.", 
    "We are actually inverted.", 
    "They use the word platform for the lowest level infrastructure, and", 
    "infrastructure for things at a higher level.", 
    "We use the word infrastructure for the lowest level of the system, and then", 
    "platforms for the higher levels, at least intermediate levels.", 
    "So for infrastructure, when you have scale and you have reliability and you", 
    "are responsible for this data--", 
    "this is the key point.", 
    "We have a ton of data.", 
    "We cannot possibly lose it.", 
    "However, we use very cheap hardware that is failing at an enormous rate.", 
    "At any point in time, this hardware is at least a few percent broken.", 
    "And the failure rates are so high that if we replicate data, just 2 copies,", 
    "we risk losing significant fraction after a year.", 
    "So we need to use 3 copies.", 
    "And we have a very active monitoring so that if you lose one, or if we", 
    "think we lost 1, we regenerate that third copy so that these failure rates", 
    "don't catch up with us.", 
    "So now that you own this data asset-- and by the way, this data is not just", 
    "data that's optional for the company.", 
    "This is a data asset.", 
    "Like, this is like the capital of the company.", 
    "For the online service.", 
    "If you lose this data, you might have to shut down.", 
    "This is really like losing money from the bank.", 
    "So when you're developing the software to maintain this data, and you are", 
    "trying to move fast, trying to add features quickly,", 
    "now you have a problem.", 
    "What happens if you corrupt the data?", 
    "You don't have backups.", 
    "You only have 3 copies.", 
    "And these 3 copies are all floating on these very low-reliability machines.", 
    "They're literally floating, right.", 
    "Copies are vanishing and being recreated all the time.", 
    "So if you corrupt something, this corruption can spread.", 
    "Has this ever happened?", 
    "It did.", 
    "We had one case of corruption that did spread really fast.", 
    "And the corruption was essentially 6 bugs lining up, one essentially", 
    "disabling the protection from the other.", 
    "Because the system's very full tolerance.", 
    "It has lots of protections.", 
    "I'm not going to go through the details of those 6 bugs.", 
    "But I can if you want to hang on afterwards and ask.", 
    "But it was really an incredible situation.", 
    "It's like 6 planets aligning.", 
    "And when they align though, we lost data.", 
    "What protected us was two things.", 
    "One is that we don't keep all of the data in the same volume.", 
    "It's all accessible from the cluster.", 
    "But it's not in the same volume.", 
    "We have multiple volumes in the cluster.", 
    "And that corruption was limited to the volume.", 
    "And the second was pure luck.", 
    "The second was that it so happened that the data in this volume was", 
    "derivative data, not raw data.", 
    "So the team that owned it, which was the relevance team, was able to", 
    "reproduce the data.", 
    "Of course they didn't like this.", 
    "They hated the fact that they had to work extra to reproduce the data.", 
    "But they did it.", 
    "Business did not die.", 
    "But the alternative is you can imagine.", 
    "So then the question becomes, if you use agile methodology, do you push", 
    "really fast and hope to fail fast?", 
    "But what if the failure means you've lost your asset?", 
    "Now there's a question.", 
    "And that's something we are actually really facing today.", 
    "Because we are completely redesigning our storage system, which is the place", 
    "where we hold these assets.", 
    "And in the process of rethinking how can we replace this [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "software, all of it, without missing a heartbeat and", 
    "especially not losing data.", 
    "So that's the big one.", 
    "The second one is that there is an assumption in agile methodology that", 
    "you can decompose it.", 
    "If you think of a project as a rectangle where the top of it is the", 
    "interface of the customer.", 
    "Agile methodology assumes that you can slice it longitudinally so that you", 
    "can work on a full slice that is meaningful to the customer and then", 
    "move to the next one, to the next one.", 
    "And in some cases you can not easily do that.", 
    "Again, the best example is the storage system.", 
    "If you change the underlying storage system, it's very difficult to find a", 
    "way to have a single longitudinal slice.", 
    "That said, because we like all the benefits we get from agile", 
    "methodology, we end up trying very hard.", 
    "So we found some way to get one of those slices.", 
    "But we can't find too many.", 
    "There are basically two levels of slicing.", 
    "And that's it.", 
    "So in the end, the project that takes two years of work will have,", 
    "basically, two major intermediate releases before the final.", 
    "And that's not what agile methodology would like.", 
    "So the Cosmos team as a whole is about 100 people, 25 in Beijing and the rest", 
    "in Bellevue, near Seattle.", 
    "And the team that works on storage is very small by comparison.", 
    "It's basically, at the moment it's 6 or 7 people.", 
    "It will eventually grow.", 
    "But it's very hard to hire these kinds of people.", 
    "So it will take a while to get to probably 10 of them.", 
    "Even so, that's a very big team, from my point of view.", 
    "Microsoft, by the way-- this is kind of a general note.", 
    "I joined Microsoft about 10 years ago now.", 
    "Before that I was at a start-up for five and a half years that I had", 
    "co-founded.", 
    "One of the things that struck me was that Microsoft would develop", 
    "reasonably big pieces of software with an unconscionably", 
    "small number of people.", 
    "This might strike you as odd in a company that has thousands and", 
    "thousands of developers.", 
    "And even in Windows you would see that.", 
    "You would see that there are two people working on the heap.", 
    "This is the heap for all of Windows and all of the apps that use Windows.", 
    "You say, wait a second.", 
    "This is, like, too few.", 
    "But that's how Microsoft operates.", 
    "Now there are consequences of that.", 
    "One of the consequences is that you often find a few of those small teams", 
    "doing roughly the same thing.", 
    "So if you look carefully at Windows, you'll see actually a few", 
    "implementations of the same thing in there.", 
    "And only one of them, hopefully, is what you use.", 
    "We prefer the iterations to be no more than two months.", 
    "Two months we consider to be quite long actually.", 
    "Ideally it's much shorter than that.", 
    "But two months are OK.", 
    "So our cadence in being in general is every six months", 
    "we call that a release.", 
    "And then every two months, that's a milestone.", 
    "That's kind of the common clock in the division.", 
    "And we're talking about the number of developers in the division who are", 
    "following this clock are about 5,000, maybe more.", 
    "So it's a pretty loud clock.", 
    "So you want to try to stay in touch with that.", 
    "Because that's how dependencies work.", 
    "The reason you want to make it even shorter is because the dependency", 
    "chain can be quite long.", 
    "So we do something.", 
    "Our customers in data mining do something.", 
    "Their customers are waiting for that.", 
    "So we don't want--", 
    "if people wait, we don't want those to string too far into the future.", 
    "People end up waiting for each other.", 
    "I thought maybe I could bring up something that might seem tangential.", 
    "But I feel it's very, very strong, at least for me.", 
    "And since I had that excuse to sit down and think, I thought I'd think", 
    "about this particular question."
