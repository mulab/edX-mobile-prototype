    "ARMANDO FOX: OK, so I assume this thing is still on.", 
    "So you guys know that I'm a fan of retro-computing.", 
    "And one of the challenges is how many languages can you write", 
    "\"Hello world\" in.", 
    "Well, this is going to stretch that a little bit.", 
    "Let me a give you a little bit of a background on the Atari 2600.", 
    "And then, I'll show you the \"Hello\"--", 
    "I got \"Hello\" to run on it, by the way, for real.", 
    "And I do have one at home.", 
    "So this is Pong--", 
    "not terribly sophisticated.", 
    "The paddles move.", 
    "Don't miss the ball.", 
    "This was a really, really successful arcade game for Atari, like arcade", 
    "where you go put quarters in.", 
    "There was a time when people played video games not in their homes, but in", 
    "these places full of machines that just did that.", 
    "It was called an arcade.", 
    "Soon it's going to be forgotten lore.", 
    "So Atari Pong was originally designed with discrete TTL.", 
    "That means no microprocessor.", 
    "All of the logic was hand designed in hardware and laid out", 
    "with individual gates.", 
    "It was a runaway hit.", 
    "People loved it.", 
    "And they thought, OK, well, maybe people would like to play this in", 
    "their living rooms.", 
    "Let's do a version that would connect to your TV.", 
    "And they hired an engineer, Al Alcorn, who is actually a Berkeley alumnus, to", 
    "design in an ASIC-- an Application Specific Integrated Circuit.", 
    "Basically, Pong on a chip, so that they could sell this for less than a", 
    "couple hundred dollars.", 
    "And it was very successful.", 
    "It had a bunch of other competitors from other companies that were now", 
    "going to get in on the home Pong and home video game action.", 
    "But they were all pretty simple.", 
    "And any given device, no matter whose you bought, only had a fixed number of", 
    "games built in.", 
    "And once you tried all those games, that was it, right?", 
    "You'd exhausted it.", 
    "So Nolan Bushnell, who's the entrepreneur who founded Atari, his", 
    "idea was what if we could make a programmable home game console, and", 
    "people could put in some kind of a cartridge or other thing?", 
    "So that way, you could always have more games being developed, right?", 
    "I mean today, this is the way home video games work.", 
    "But that was a revolutionary idea in 1975.", 
    "Now, the constraints they were working under--", 
    "what was technology like for PCs in 1977?", 
    "Their target price was $200, which today would be like $700.", 
    "So for its time, it was still pretty expensive.", 
    "But they thought this would kind of be the upper bound of what parents would", 
    "buy their kids for Christmas-- $200.", 
    "However, at that time RAM was $8 a kilobyte.", 
    "Let me say that again, $8 a kilobyte.", 
    "So even a really low-res, crappy screen display of 200 by 160 pixels, 8", 
    "bits per pixel would have cost over $120.", 
    "There's your budget right there.", 
    "So no frame buffer, OK?", 
    "No memory map display--", 
    "think about that for a moment.", 
    "So instead, they did a bunch of interesting tricks, which I'll", 
    "explain, around another custom chip called the Television Interface", 
    "Adapter or TIA.", 
    "It was named \"Stella\" after the bicycle owned by the engineer who was", 
    "its principal designer.", 
    "And the idea was to encapsulate a lot of the logic that you was required to", 
    "display pictures on TV in a way that would be reusable for different games.", 
    "The processor that it used, like the Apple II, it used a 6502-derivative.", 
    "But they thought they could save a couple of bucks by using this version", 
    "called the 6507, which doesn't have all the address lines.", 
    "So you can only address 4K of memory.", 
    "So even if you'd had more than 4K memory, that's the size of your", 
    "address space.", 
    "That's how big your programs can be.", 
    "No cash, no floating point, no multiply-divide instructions, ran at", 
    "about one megahertz.", 
    "And then, you had to add in the cost of the joystick, the power supply, all", 
    "of the other stuff that comes with it.", 
    "So they couldn't really spend a lot of money on the actual circuitry that", 
    "would run the games.", 
    "Here's the memory map, in case you're interested.", 
    "Here's your RAM.", 
    "You get 128 bytes of RAM.", 
    "If you're a game programmer, that's how much memory space you", 
    "have for your data.", 
    "You're game code lives up here in about 4K of memory.", 
    "So that's pretty much it.", 
    "There's a bunch of other programmable I/O registers that talk to the", 
    "joysticks and stuff like that.", 
    "So how do you program something that has a display without having a frame", 
    "buffer where you can draw stuff?", 
    "This is kind of what the system looks like.", 
    "And it connects to a TV set.", 
    "So to explain why this is interesting, I have to explain a little bit about", 
    "how analog TVs work.", 
    "So NTSC television--", 
    "this is a standard that goes back to the 1940s, to the original", 
    "black and white TVs.", 
    "Remember, this is all analog technology.", 
    "So how does a black and white TV draw a picture on the screen?", 
    "There's a single electron gun that sweeps across the screen", 
    "from left to right.", 
    "And then, when it reaches the right edge the screen, it zooms back to the", 
    "left edge and paints the next line.", 
    "And when it gets to the bottom right corner, it sweeps back up to the top", 
    "left corner.", 
    "And then, it starts a new frame.", 
    "Now, I'm simplifying a little bit.", 
    "Because for variety technical reasons, a frame is actually drawn in two", 
    "passes where you draw every other line.", 
    "And then, you go back and fill in the ones in between.", 
    "But that's not important to understanding the principle of how", 
    "this works.", 
    "The idea is that if you're programming something to do this, right, once you", 
    "get to the end of a TV line, it actually takes a finite amount of time", 
    "for the beam to sweep back and begin drawing the next line.", 
    "And when you get to the bottom of the screen, it takes a finite amount of", 
    "time for the beam to sweep back up to the top corner of the screen, so you", 
    "can draw the next frame.", 
    "So remember that.", 
    "Because that's the key to how you can build a device that plays games, even", 
    "though you don't have a frame buffer.", 
    "If you look at the signal on an oscilloscope that's going into the TV,", 
    "this is what it looks like, right?", 
    "At the beginning of each line, there's a timing burst called", 
    "the horizontal blanking.", 
    "There's a sync pulse which is basically a signal to the TV's analog", 
    "circuitry saying, hey, a line is about to start.", 
    "Turn on the electron gun, so that it will start painting", 
    "pixels on the screen.", 
    "Then, there's an analog signal whose intensity controls how bright the", 
    "signal is at each point along that line.", 
    "You can kind of think of it as pixels.", 
    "Although, it's continuous rather than discrete.", 
    "And then, at the end of the line, there's another horizontal pulse that", 
    "signals the TV circuitry.", 
    "OK, it's time to sweep the beam back over to the left edge and start all", 
    "over again.", 
    "So you have an NTSC television.", 
    "And you've got 525 lines that are produced that way.", 
    "And then, at the end of the last line, there's a long interval.", 
    "There's a pulse here that says, OK, it's time to return the beam to the", 
    "top left corner.", 
    "And then, there's this long blank interval to allow the TV time to move", 
    "the beam all the way back up to the corner.", 
    "OK, so this is kind of the simplified version of an oscilloscope, looking at", 
    "the TV signal.", 
    "Why is this relevant?", 
    "The way they solve the frame buffer problem is they actually have a bunch", 
    "of registers that hold the horizontal locations of various", 
    "things on one line.", 
    "So, the idea is you load up these registers.", 
    "And once the line starts being drawn, their custom IC, that produces the TV", 
    "signal, will consult these registers as the line is being drawn.", 
    "And it'll say, ah, at this point I'm going to change the color to red.", 
    "And I'm going to draw this little pattern.", 
    "Then at this point, I'm going to change the color again.", 
    "I'm going to draw this other little pattern.", 
    "There's not really that much you could do, because you have to hold", 
    "it a line at a time.", 
    "And then, how do you change what's going to be on the next line?", 
    "Well, remember, at the end of each line there is a blanking interval,", 
    "which is the time it takes the TV to retrace to go back to the left edge", 
    "for the next line.", 
    "That's your window of opportunity to change what's in the registers.", 
    "So you're drawing this screen one line at a time.", 
    "And what about actually computing things that happen in the game?", 
    "That happens during the vertical retrace.", 
    "At the end of drawing a frame, you now have a long time, like a few hundred", 
    "machine instructions, to run the game logic.", 
    "That's as complicated as your game can be.", 
    "So you draw scan line.", 
    "The circuitry automatically uses what you've put into those registers to", 
    "draw things along those lines.", 
    "Remember, what was the heritage of this thing?", 
    "It came from Pong.", 
    "And there was also another game Atari had in the arcades called Tank, where", 
    "each player drives a tank around.", 
    "You shoot at each other.", 
    "And there's barriers and stuff.", 
    "But what these games all had in common is there's two players.", 
    "There's a notion of a ball or a missile, a thing that flies around.", 
    "There's a notion of a thing that the player controls, a tank or a paddle.", 
    "There's a playing field, which usually is symmetrical.", 
    "And there's some little bleeps and bloops that the games make when you", 
    "hit the other player, or hit the ball with the paddle and stuff.", 
    "So what their original vision was-- let's generalize that.", 
    "So they built all of this hardware to essentially make that type of game", 
    "programmable in this system.", 
    "The other thing you have to know is well, your game logic needs to know,", 
    "did your ball hit the paddle, or did it not hit the paddle?", 
    "Well, that's not too hard.", 
    "Because as the thing is being drawn, right, the same thing that's", 
    "inspecting the registers and drawing the scan line, at any given moment it", 
    "can detect if two registers are going to collide.", 
    "And then it can then save that information in another register that", 
    "your game logic can look at.", 
    "So your game logic can pretty easily see, during a given scan line, were", 
    "there any two objects that collided?", 
    "And depending on what they were, you can take the appropriate action.", 
    "The way this works for the microprocessor is that when you are", 
    "writing your code, in assembly language of course, high-level", 
    "languages are out of the question for this.", 
    "You're writing assembly code.", 
    "So you have your vertical blanking interval at the start of the line.", 
    "You can do some work there, put some things in the registers.", 
    "Then, you stop.", 
    "You halt the microprocessor.", 
    "And then, what happens is the TV will draw the scan line.", 
    "As soon as the scan line starts getting drawn, you'll get an interrupt", 
    "that will allow you to keep going.", 
    "So you basically do a bunch of work.", 
    "You stop.", 
    "And you wait for the TV line to start being drawn.", 
    "Now, you can start doing other work, right?", 
    "So this is all on the basis of write a little bit of code--", 
    "And by the way, what if your code runs too slowly, or it runs longer than it", 
    "takes before the TVs ready to paint the line?", 
    "Then, you get like a rolling TV image, right?", 
    "It's a visual mess.", 
    "So you have to actually count how many clock cycles it takes your code to", 
    "execute to make sure it fits into those little windows.", 
    "So here's what the video frame looks like.", 
    "You get about 10 microseconds of time to do it during the horizontal", 
    "blanking interval.", 
    "You wait for a pulse that says, I'm about to start drawing the line.", 
    "You display up to 192 lines, because there is overscan", 
    "and vertical blanking.", 
    "What are those?", 
    "Overscan is the fact that different TVs were manufactured to sort of", 
    "different tolerances.", 
    "So even though there's 525 actual screen lines, only about 480 of them", 
    "are displayable where you can guarantee that every", 
    "TV will have them.", 
    "So the convention is you only do those 480 lines.", 
    "And the lines above and below you, just leave them blank.", 
    "Because some TVs might cut them off.", 
    "So as a game programmer, that's more time that you can use.", 
    "Since it's not painting other lines.", 
    "So how much time do you have for your game logic?", 
    "It takes about 64 microseconds for the TV to draw one line, independent of", 
    "the size the TV.", 
    "That's about 5,000 cycles at 1.2 megahertz.", 
    "And the 6502 has mostly two and three cycle instructions.", 
    "In a given frame, over 67 lines, you can execute about 4,000 assembly", 
    "instructions.", 
    "That's your game logic.", 
    "Your game is what can you do in 4,000 assembly language instructions that", 
    "are updated once per frame?", 
    "So how do you write \"Hello World\"?", 
    "Well, there's no printing, right?", 
    "If you want to draw stuff on the screen, you have to figure out where", 
    "the blocks would go that make up the text.", 
    "And every time you're about to start drawing a new line, you have to have", 
    "some look-up table of what you want to draw on that particular line.", 
    "Update the registers at the right time.", 
    "And make sure you reset it at the same time on each pass, or the TV", 
    "picture will roll.", 
    "Because they had designed this to accommodate games like Pong and Tank", 
    "that had a symmetrical playing field, what they did is they dedicated 20", 
    "whole bits of RAM for you to encode what the playfield of", 
    "one line looks like.", 
    "And they're drawn double wide.", 
    "And depending on the setting of another bit, it's either symmetrically", 
    "reflected on both ends, or it's repeated without flipping.", 
    "But those are your only choices.", 
    "If you want to draw playing field that is in any way asymmetric, you have to", 
    "do another trick.", 
    "Which is time it, so that once the first half of the line has finished", 
    "being drawn, you start modifying registers.", 
    "So that by the time you draw the second half of the line, you'll", 
    "actually have new content loaded, right?", 
    "This is programming for real programmers.", 
    "And of course, to save another couple of dollars one of those registers has", 
    "its bit image reversed.", 
    "Because that made it easier to do the hardware design.", 
    "So this is what you would have if you wanted to do an", 
    "asymmetric playing field.", 
    "There's three registers that control what is being drawn", 
    "on the playing field.", 
    "The normal operation, that they had envisioned, is before the line starts", 
    "you load up all three of them.", 
    "You let the line be drawn.", 
    "And then, you reload them as its sweeping back for the next line.", 
    "But programmers discovered that once the line starts to be drawn, once the", 
    "contents of the PF zero register have been drawn on the line, that register", 
    "isn't going to be examined again until the second half of the screen.", 
    "So during this yellow window, if you time it just right, you can change it,", 
    "so that the second half of the screen will be totally different from the", 
    "left half of the screen.", 
    "OK, very hairy stuff.", 
    "And in fact, you can see that in a lot of screenshots, although there are", 
    "some basic elements that are mirrored or symmetric, there are also elements", 
    "that are asymmetric.", 
    "So that's how that's being done.", 
    "These are screenshots from a variety of games, none of which is more than", 
    "4K bytes of code, by the way.", 
    "So you could do some impressive things if you knew what you were doing.", 
    "What about collision detection?", 
    "Well, the elements that the hardware supports is that it has a concept of", 
    "the background.", 
    "And you could say, make the background this color.", 
    "It has the playing field, which are immovable obstacles, that could be in", 
    "a different color.", 
    "There's the ball, the thing that moves around.", 
    "And there's also the idea of players and missiles.", 
    "So if it's a game where you shoot each other, each player object has a little", 
    "missile that it's associated with.", 
    "And then, if you add all these up, there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 different", 
    "kinds of objects, any pair of which could collide with each other.", 
    "And conveniently, there's 15 possible ways that two objects can collide.", 
    "So it fits into a 2-byte collision register.", 
    "So there's another register where each bit means a pair of objects that", 
    "collided while I was drawing the scanline.", 
    "And that's how you detect collisions in your game logic.", 
    "The things that you put-- the sprites, the player movements, they can move", 
    "horizontally.", 
    "So if you're just having a player move across the screen, you don't actually", 
    "have to reload the register every time.", 
    "You could just say for the next nine cycles, or for the next nine lines,", 
    "each line advance the player to the right by one pixel.", 
    "And then, the system would automatically do that for you.", 
    "So again, why would you do that?", 
    "Because you're designing games like Pong and Tank, where most of the time", 
    "you're moving linearly or, maybe, along very simple diagonals.", 
    "You could change the width of things.", 
    "You could change the color, right?", 
    "Remember, I said there's a notion of the screen background.", 
    "And you could say the background should be this color.", 
    "If you change that value every time you redraw the screen, you're rotating", 
    "the color map really fast.", 
    "You can get a nice shimmery effect.", 
    "How about sound?", 
    "They're 1-bit sound generators.", 
    "They make sounds that you would expect, based on being 1 bit sound", 
    "generators.", 
    "You could generate random sequences to have things like noise, and grunts,", 
    "and buzzes.", 
    "You could do various kinds of little beeps.", 
    "But that's about it--", 
    "not much in the way of a sound card.", 
    "It was the number one Christmas gift in 1979 partly because, as I mentioned", 
    "earlier in the course, they were the first platform to have \"Space", 
    "Invaders.\" And at the time \"Space Invaders\" was the arcade game that was", 
    "swallowing all the quarters.", 
    "So their sales doubled every year for the next three years, until a lot of", 
    "other companies said, hey, this is great.", 
    "We can start making games for this home console and cash in.", 
    "And they started making a bunch of really crappy games.", 
    "In fact, there is a true urban legend.", 
    "There's actually footage of this on the internet where Atari had a version", 
    "of a game called \"ET\" that it was so bad they had to bury them in a", 
    "landfill in New Mexico.", 
    "Because they couldn't sell the ones they produced.", 
    "They couldn't even give them away.", 
    "After 14 years, they officially retired the product.", 
    "You can now play it in simulator form.", 
    "Or if you're like me, you actually have one at home.", 
    "Somebody was nice enough to create a system where they created a meta", 
    "cartridge that you can plug a USB stick into.", 
    "So all of the Atari games are now on the internet.", 
    "And you can have all of the games ever created, including", 
    "ones created by hobbyists.", 
    "There are actually competitions every year for who can create the best new 8", 
    "bit Atari games.", 
    "So there's a thriving subculture.", 
    "And I have every game ever created, I believe, for the Atari 2600 on a", 
    "single meta cartridge.", 
    "So let's see a quick demo.", 
    "Of course, I don't have my Atari 2600 here.", 
    "So I'm going to have to use the emulator.", 
    "It's called \"Stella.\" And it's free, of course.", 
    "So what I'm doing is the equivalent of selecting a cartridge to jam into the", 
    "slot, right?", 
    "And remember, that the way this-- what's a cartridge?", 
    "It's a thing with a ROM chip on it.", 
    "And the ROM occupies that part of the address map permanently, right?", 
    "So that's your operating system.", 
    "You now have this 4K.", 
    "And there's some registers you can use.", 
    "So here's my--", 
    "sorry the screen got cut off.", 
    "But here is my \"Hello world\" This is the simplest \"Hello world\" that I", 
    "could possibly imagine writing.", 
    "I decided to kind of go nuts with the colors, right?", 
    "So what did I do?", 
    "On each scan line, I just increment the register that says, what's the", 
    "background color for this particular line?", 
    "And I guess that's the order of the color map.", 
    "Why does it print \"Hello world\" twice?", 
    "Because the playing field is symmetrical by default, right?", 
    "My only other option would have been to invert the right hand side, and", 
    "have kind of a mirror image.", 
    "But if I wanted the right hand side to be totally blank, I would have had to", 
    "do that trick where as soon as it starts drawing a line, I put zeros", 
    "into all those registers.", 
    "And I just didn't have the patience to count cycles.", 
    "The one thing I did do, though, is you can control whether the playfield,", 
    "which is the obstacles, the \"Hello world\" is drawn in a different color", 
    "on each side of the screen.", 
    "So that's why it did that.", 
    "Then, I thought, OK, well maybe I can get really fancy.", 
    "What if I did a version--", 
    "right?", 
    "If anybody ever played \"Missile Command,\" the end of the game looks", 
    "like this, right?", 
    "So what's going on here?", 
    "Instead of changing the color for every scanline, I changed the color", 
    "once per frame.", 
    "So once the code is in steady state, you don't really have to", 
    "do anything, right?", 
    "So there is some advantage to what the hardware can do for you.", 
    "And then, I decided to really crazy, and see if I could do something that", 
    "had motion.", 
    "And I came up with that.", 
    "Don't all cheer at once, right?", 
    "On every scanline, I'm drawing the player's missile.", 
    "But, of course,-- so why is the missile being drawn all the way down", 
    "the screen as a stripe, instead of as a little ball?", 
    "Well, because by default, every scanline is the same, right?", 
    "So if you think about it, a good quiz question would be-- what happens if", 
    "your program goes into an infinite loop?", 
    "What would you see on the screen if your program was stuck", 
    "in an infinite loop?", 
    "You'd see vertical stripes, right?", 
    "Because what would happen is, whatever the contents of the registers that", 
    "define a scanline were, if those registers never change, you're just", 
    "going to keep drawing the same thing over and over again on every line.", 
    "So you'll get a vertical stripe pattern.", 
    "So I was too lazy to erase the ball.", 
    "So that's what happens when you move the ball horizontally, right?", 
    "Remember, I said you don't have to redraw the ball.", 
    "If all you're doing is moving it, you can just say, move it left to right by", 
    "some number of pixels.", 
    "But you're also supposed to remember that the ball only exists on one line", 
    "of the screen.", 
    "And I didn't do that.", 
    "I left it there for every line.", 
    "As an example of what that looks like in real life, so these are the byte", 
    "patterns the defined \"Hello world.\" But it doesn't look like it, because", 
    "of the three bytes one of them is flipped.", 
    "And in the other ones, not all the bits are used.", 
    "And of course, if you were doing this in real life you would have some", 
    "tools, right, where you could kind of lay out something on graph paper.", 
    "And it would print out the right patterns for you.", 
    "But I didn't have those tools.", 
    "So I store a signal that says, making the playfield halves", 
    "be different colors.", 
    "What's going on here with WSYNC is a register that means I'm ready to pause", 
    "until you wake me up at the beginning of the next line.", 
    "So as soon as you execute this instruction, your program will halt.", 
    "And the next time the next line begins you'll get woken up and continue.", 
    "So what I'm doing here is basically skipping three lines.", 
    "That's the time that the vertical sync comes at the beginning of the frame.", 
    "I set up some counters.", 
    "I count 37 blank lines for the top of the overscan.", 
    "And then, in my main loop, basically I'm looking at that table of text.", 
    "And on every line I'm pulling the right byte sequence out of the table,", 
    "stuffing it into the registers, making sure that the", 
    "registers are all set up.", 
    "And then, what do I do?", 
    "I wait, right?", 
    "Once the registers are all set up, I halt.", 
    "The TIA does its thing.", 
    "It outputs a scanline.", 
    "And then, I wake up and do the next line.", 
    "So this is what game programming was like in the 1970s.", 
    "You guys have much better tools today.", 
    "But the thing that hasn't changed is you need ingenuity to get around", 
    "technology limitations.", 
    "Hopefully, this is a somewhat inspiring, if silly, example", 
    "of how to do that.", 
    "Is HKN in here, by the way?", 
    "OK, good.", 
    "What, Richard?", 
    "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "PROFESSOR: So yeah, so in case you weren't limited enough, the number of", 
    "general purpose registers in the 6502 is one register, the accumulator.", 
    "But by the way, that's one of the things that makes the instructions so", 
    "compact, right?", 
    "You don't have to specify which register it operates on, because", 
    "there's only one choice.", 
    "There's also registers called \"X\" and \"Y.\" But the only thing they're really", 
    "useful for is for indexing, like if you're doing a memory index off of a", 
    "base address indexing into a table.", 
    "Because you can't do arithmetic with the \"X\" and \"Y\" registers.", 
    "You can increment them and decrement them.", 
    "But that's all.", 
    "The only other operations are add and subtract.", 
    "And you can only do those on the accumulator.", 
    "So yeah, it's a pretty limited programming model.", 
    "Yeah?", 
    "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?", 
    "PROFESSOR: How does it support--", 
    "STUDENT: Color.", 
    "PROFESSOR: --how does it support color?", 
    "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?", 
    "PROFESSOR: A graphics card?", 
    "It is the graphics card, my friend.", 
    "No, the way it supports color is there's a--", 
    "the part of the story I didn't tell, is the TV standard NTSC originally was", 
    "for black and white.", 
    "And when color TV technology came along, there was actually a lot of", 
    "controversy on how to make a standard for color broadcasting.", 
    "And one of the standards being considered would have made color TV", 
    "incompatible with black and white.", 
    "So everybody who had a black and white TV would have been unable to view", 
    "color TV programming.", 
    "Anybody ever have a black and white TV?", 
    "Do you remember your parents having a black and white TV?", 
    "Do those things even have that anymore?", 
    "If you remember, on a black and white TV, you could watch color TV programs.", 
    "But they would just show up in black and white.", 
    "It took an enormous amount of engineering to actually get that", 
    "backward compatibility to happen.", 
    "And there's a separate part of the TV signal I didn't talk about that", 
    "essentially deals with how color information is overlaid on the", 
    "brightness information.", 
    "And then, the Atari chip that does the TV output can generate that part of", 
    "the signal.", 
    "But that's it, right?", 
    "There's no frame buffer.", 
    "There's no graphics card.", 
    "It's just you and a couple of registers.", 
    "It's like trekking in the desert or something trying to write a game.", 
    "OK, well, I want to stop so that HKN has time to do their stuff.", 
    "Thank you all very much.", 
    "Hope this was fun.", 
    "And I'm really, really looking forward to the posters next week.", 
    "Have a great weekend.", 
    "And good luck with your other finals and what all that other stuff is.", 
    "[APPLAUSE]"
