    "OK.",

    "and looked at the JS that came down and so you were able", 
    "to deobfuscate it.", 
    "In a typical Rails app, you really saw a lot of these dollar calls to jQuery", 
    "registering crazy jQuery plugins.", 
    "Everybody was making jQuery plugins that did this, that, and the other.", 
    "Some of them made sense--", 
    "things like UI widgets or calendar widgets or credit card validation,", 
    "number validation, those kinds of things.", 
    "But you didn't really have objects.", 
    "What you had was a lot of registration of these event handlers, to exec a JS", 
    "function, like we talked about at the beginning.", 
    "But what it's doing is--", 
    "if you looked at the code, it certainly wouldn't be code that you", 
    "would expect came out of people that really thought about abstraction and", 
    "capsulation, things you're supposed to be learning in CS class.", 
    "That's changed a lot in the last two years, in part because people realized", 
    "that so much of what they want to build are things like the Sports", 
    "Center app and the New York Times app I showed you.", 
    "That these concepts from software engineering actually should exist in", 
    "your JS as well.", 
    "So a lot of frameworks have popped up.", 
    "The first one, which is probably where you should start if you want to play", 
    "with this, is Backbone.js.", 
    "It's very lightweight.", 
    "It came out of a project that--", 
    "and there's another project that's sort of related to it-- an independent", 
    "called Underscore, which is a bunch of nice JS helper functions, if you've", 
    "played with Underscore it all.", 
    "But it's really lightweight.", 
    "It has the concept of routing.", 
    "So you can have these URLs that don't trigger server reloads, with the", 
    "hashes and whatnot.", 
    "So you could have mapping of new URLs to go to new functions.", 
    "It gives you objects for models and collections and views.", 
    "Collections are exactly what you expect, iterations.", 
    "With events, when models get added or removed from", 
    "collections, you get fired.", 
    "The models--", 
    "this works really, really well with Rails.", 
    "Like crazy well with Rails.", 
    "By default, if you had sort of the Rails CRUD option, CRUD controllers", 
    "that we were talking about, in your app, you could have Backbone up and", 
    "running in minutes.", 
    "Your stuff, JS model, would pull down the right representation", 
    "with almost no work.", 
    "And then views, you have to do a little more of jQuery stuff.", 
    "But it gives you an object that you can test independently.", 
    "It's not quite MVC, but it's close.", 
    "C is collection versus controller.", 
    "You could have controllers.", 
    "You could have plain old JS objects in here, too.", 
    "This is what we use mostly at Pivotal, what I've done on a", 
    "bunch of side projects.", 
    "And I like it.", 
    "And there's a neat ecosystem building up around it.", 
    "There's a pretty heavyweight thing called Marionette that goes with", 
    "Backbone that's really nice, that helps with even more", 
    "production-quality code.", 
    "So I'm a big fan of Backbone.", 
    "Take a look at it.", 
    "Ember is another one that's getting a lot of traction.", 
    "It's really early.", 
    "It acts a lot more like an application.", 
    "Backbone, for example, feels a lot more like kind of the JS we've been", 
    "talking about.", 
    "I think they actually have an event loop that they manage.", 
    "I've only fiddled with it a little bit.", 
    "It's a little MVC-ish.", 
    "The thing that this one and the other ones I'm going to mention, it's a", 
    "little different, is that they like to set up for you the idea that when your", 
    "model updates--", 
    "let's go back to Backbone for a second.", 
    "When your model updates in Backbone, you'll get an event", 
    "and you'll do something.", 
    "An event model gets added to a collection, removed from a collection.", 
    "You'll get events, and you'll have to do stuff--", 
    "show views, hide views, delete views, whatever.", 
    "There's this class of these front-end frameworks where they talk about data", 
    "binding, where instead of writing code to do that stuff for", 
    "you, you provide templates.", 
    "We haven't really talked about templates, but yes, you can do", 
    "templates in JS as well, and a lot of people do.", 
    "And set up these data bindings between your DOM and the objects.", 
    "When the object changes, basically, stuff magically updates", 
    "in the DOM for you.", 
    "Which is a little crazy.", 
    "It's a little hard to deal with.", 
    "It breaks my brain a little bit.", 
    "Ember is kind of early.", 
    "It came out of SproutCore, which is what Apple built MobileMe on.", 
    "MobileME is gone.", 
    "SproutCore is out of Apple.", 
    "Yehudah Katz, who's a big guy with the [INAUDIBLE] he's on a Rails committer", 
    "and a jQuery committer is working on this mostly.", 
    "It's still early, and it's a bit of a memory hog.", 
    "But it's worth looking at, just to see where things are going.", 
    "There's something came out of Google called Angular, which I like to think", 
    "about as Ember Light--", 
    "very, very lightweight.", 
    "This was bouncing around Google for a long, long time, and it was bouncing", 
    "around outside of Google.", 
    "It has Google's imprimatur now, and they're pushing it as", 
    "an open source framework.", 
    "Again, a lot lighter weight.", 
    "The big thing about these data binding frameworks, and the thing that kind of", 
    "drives me nuts, and why I tend to have a hard time with them, is that going", 
    "and manipulating the DOM is hard, and sometimes you need to do that.", 
    "Every time you break out of how they want you to write an Angular app or an", 
    "Ember app, when you try to break outside that mold, it gets really", 
    "hard, and you get headaches.", 
    "Angular is like that as well, but it's lighter weight.", 
    "But similar concepts.", 
    "And because Omer's here, I've got to talk about Enyo.", 
    "This was the second framework that they wrote at Palm.", 
    "It's what they did to take the phone stuff up to the tablet.", 
    "It's open source now, and they're pushing it into browsers.", 
    "So it works reasonably well.", 
    "What's neat about this is the DOM is free declarative", 
    "in JavaScript objects.", 
    "And you can do data binding-like things.", 
    "It's a little bit less painful.", 
    "But what I really like it for is you can use it just as a UI-Control layer.", 
    "So you've got concepts of buttons and lists and things that you only get in", 
    "some of the heavier weight frameworks.", 
    "Backbone won't give that to you.", 
    "Ember can, but it's a little bit easier to deal with", 
    "than some of the others.", 
    "Bit of a dark horse, but they're pushing it now.", 
    "They're getting a lot of press around it, and it's worth taking a look at.", 
    "If you do look, though, everybody's writing a JavaScript framework.", 
    "10 years ago, everybody wrote an RSS reader.", 
    "Then everybody wrote Twitter clients.", 
    "Now everybody seems to be writing JavaScript frameworks.", 
    "I'm going to stick with the test one.", 
    "I'm not going to write one.", 
    "But there's a lot out there.", 
    "There's a lot of comparison.", 
    "You can find out the pros and cons of many of these.", 
    "Maybe you don't need them for the ones in this class.", 
    "But if you want to build something like Sports Center or New York Times,", 
    "you're going to want that eventually.", 
    "So at the end here, a little bit of a wrap up.", 
    "Your JavaScript in modern web apps is what the client plays with.", 
    "It's what the end users play with.", 
    "It's what we want to make them happy, so that they can get a hold of our", 
    "data or interact with our data, whether it's movies or news or sports.", 
    "That interactivity in the browser is what makes them happy, and JS is what", 
    "gives them that.", 
    "Remember that first.", 
    "That's why you're doing this, why you're learning this language and why", 
    "you're learning these quirky things about DOM and dealing with this stuff.", 
    "And also remember that JavaScript is a real language.", 
    "It can be frustrating, and can feel like a toy a lot of the time.", 
    "But if you take the DOM stuff away, you could do inheritance composition.", 
    "All the big names.", 
    "There was a good post I saw about a year ago where somebody said", 
    "eventually you want to do all the gang of four design patterns and prototypal", 
    "inheritance anyway.", 
    "So you can.", 
    "So don't forget that JS is a real language, and you can do really neat", 
    "things with it.", 
    "Yes, you can write tests with it.", 
    "That's why Jasmine exists.",

    "And don't forget that your JS really deserves to be part of the app.", 
    "Treat it like the rest of your code, and you'll be happier.", 
    "And your users will be happier.", 
    "You'll have fewer bugs.", 
    "You'll be creating value every day, which is why we do this.",
