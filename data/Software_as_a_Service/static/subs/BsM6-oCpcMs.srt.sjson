    "ARMANDO FOX: OK, so, well, let's go through these.", 
    "Usually results in more concise code, fewer total lines--", 
    "actually we just did an example where the code by every measure improved,", 
    "but it got bigger.", 
    "So conciseness is in the eye of the beholder, right?", 
    "Minimum total number lines of code in your app is not really a measure of", 
    "conciseness.", 
    "It's whether a given task is being done with clarity in the smallest", 
    "amount of space.", 
    "And in this case, getting to clarity resulted in adding more", 
    "code, simple as that.", 
    "So that's not true.", 
    "Should not cause existing test to fail--", 
    "well, even in our simple example, at one point, we changed the calling API.", 
    "When we encapsulated that thing in a class, soon as you have a class, you", 
    "have to call an initializer, right?", 
    "We didn't have to do that in the original version of the code.", 
    "So if we had tests that tested the original version of the code, they", 
    "would have immediately failed for structural reasons alone.", 
    "So in fact, it's not a problem if refactoring temporarily causes", 
    "existing tests to fail, but as long as you know why it failed.", 
    "Did it fail because you actually broke something?", 
    "Or did it fail because you've changed the structure of the code in a way", 
    "that makes it incompatible the assumptions of the test?", 
    "The first kind of failure should be an alarm, because it means that in", 
    "refactoring, your knowledge about what could be factored was incorrect.", 
    "Something fails for a logical reason.", 
    "But if it's a structural reason, you change the name of the method, you", 
    "move something out into a helper, and you have to call it differently than", 
    "it used to be called.", 
    "Those are structural reasons that might cause tests to fail.", 
    "And you've got to fix the testes.", 
    "So that means, by the way, that blue, in case you weren't following that", 
    "explanation, is the correct answer, that often you have to change or", 
    "expand your test suite in order to go along with a", 
    "factoring that you've done.", 
    "And in terms of explicit versus implicit customer requirements, the", 
    "customer doesn't care for codes readable for the most part.", 
    "They care if it works.", 
    "You're the one who suffers if the code's not readable, or the poor", 
    "schmoe who has to come after you and fix it all up.", 
    "So you could maybe argue that it's an implicit customer requirement at best.", 
    "But rarely will the customers say, and by the way, your code needs to have a", 
    "flog score below some number.", 
    "So with that, we will temporarily leave off of our refactoring.", 
    "We'll revisit some of these ideas we talk about design patterns.", 
    "But for now, it's time to talk about teams, a topic about which my", 
    "colleague is much more qualified.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: I'm going to get through one or two these today.", 
    "But the first one is it takes a team, and I'm going to talk about Scrum.", 
    "And I think I just wanted to say about what's interesting about this set of", 
    "the lectures is since I'm old enough to be your grandfather here.", 
    "So I've been here a long time, and there's a bunch of stuff that you've", 
    "learned now that's going to go away.", 
    "I learned stuff that people can't believe I learned.", 
    "But there's some things that are going to work just as well you're", 
    "going to learn now.", 
    "It's going to work your whole career.", 
    "And that's the team stuff here.", 
    "The people skills, people aren't going to change very much", 
    "for the next 50 years.", 
    "Now that steroids are banned, maybe they're not going to change that much.", 
    "But people getting along with people, how to lead a group of people, how to", 
    "be successful--", 
    "this is something you're going to want to learn, because you're going to need", 
    "it your whole time.", 
    "So for me personalizing this team stuff is I was on the wrestling teams", 
    "both in high school and college.", 
    "And we won a state championship.", 
    "That's me right there.", 
    "That's right, Armando said I could wrestle him to the floor.", 
    "I'm pretty sure that's true.", 
    "So wrestling's an individual sport.", 
    "So kind of weird, how did I learn how to be a team?", 
    "I just happened to be on teams in high school and college that had really", 
    "great coaches.", 
    "And they felt that the way to have a successful wrestling team is not just", 
    "a bunch of individual stars, but to pull together and figure out how you", 
    "root for each other and help each other.", 
    "You'd win collectively, even though you're all individuals.", 
    "So somehow from that I got how to lead teams and form teams to be successful.", 
    "So if you look at my career, everything's team-oriented.", 
    "I often co-teach like Armando.", 
    "I've co-authored six books.", 
    "Everyone is co-authored, like the one with Armando.", 
    "Most of my papers are co-authored.", 
    "The research projects I've done, I've done 10 or 11 five-year projects", 
    "overlapping.", 
    "They're all the with multiple faculty.", 
    "So everything I do is with groups of people.", 
    "And I find it more effective this way.", 
    "This happened last year.", 
    "This is actually a 50-year reunion.", 
    "This is my good friend who was my best man at my wedding.", 
    "And I was at his.", 
    "That's him and I almost 50 years apart.", 
    "And that's our wrestling coach.", 
    "So pay attention to this.", 
    "This stuff is going to matter your whole career.", 
    "Some of the programming language stuff is going to come and go, but not", 
    "team-oriented things.", 
    "So the interesting thing is now software engineering is a team sport.", 
    "It used to be an individual sport.", 
    "It used to be like the individual wrestlers.", 
    "There are people I know who were at the state of their software at that", 
    "time, that the hero programmer, the individual was one of that thinks.", 
    "Like Ken Thompson, Ken Thompson, the co-inventor of Unix, he", 
    "was a Berkeley student.", 
    "Bill Joy, he's the guy I mentioned.", 
    "He was one of the founders of Berkeley software Unix, kind of the first open", 
    "source project.", 
    "He was a brilliant image programmer.", 
    "He came up with VI over the weekend, the visual editor.", 
    "John Osterhout, who I mentioned, when he was a young faculty member here, he", 
    "wrote a computer-aided design tool all by himself that was better than", 
    "anything that was out there.", 
    "We are now in the post-superhero programmer era.", 
    "You don't hear of individuals doing that anymore.", 
    "So I think what's happened is basically the bar of functionality and", 
    "quality is too high for one person to do it all by themselves.", 
    "So that era is behind.", 
    "You don't hear people doing it alone.", 
    "You hear Linus Torvads with Linux, but it wasn't just him doing that.", 
    "He's leading a very large group of people in the open source thing.", 
    "So you don't hear that anymore.", 
    "So you have to figure out how to work in groups.", 
    "So to have a successful career, you're going to not only have great", 
    "programming chops, but you have to work well with others and", 
    "help make a team win.", 
    "So what does help making a team win?", 
    "This is Fred Brooks, one of our heroes in computing.", 
    "He's quoting his basketball coach at University of North Carolina.", 
    "He said, \"There are no winners on a losing team, and no losers on a", 
    "winning team.\"", 
    "You have to do what it takes to make your team win.", 
    "You can't be well, I was fine, but the other guys sucked.", 
    "And so I did OK.", 
    "That's not how teams work.", 
    "The teams collectively work together.", 
    "And you have to figure that out.", 
    "And this is a thing that the feedback we get from industry that people care", 
    "a lot about teams.", 
    "That's how you learn how to work with teams.", 
    "Now the good news, and one of the things that Armando and I are excited", 
    "about teaching the course this way is that software has been reinvented in a", 
    "way that makes it easier to match the class.", 
    "So Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, came up with this term", 
    "the two pizza team.", 
    "And as Amando's talked about, just because the calories per year go up", 
    "for Americans, doesn't mean the teams are getting smaller.", 
    "It meant like say four to nine people would get together.", 
    "And that's an effective size.", 
    "Now how do you organize that team?", 
    "There's been a terminology, came up a few years ago, called Scrum, which", 
    "comes from rugby.", 
    "And the idea is every day at the same time, the two pizza team gets together", 
    "and you go around in a circle and you ask each other questions and", 
    "see where you are.", 
    "If you want to learn more about that, that book does it.", 
    "That's the thing about team stuff-- it's pretty straightforward.", 
    "You answer these three questions--", 
    "what have you done since yesterday?", 
    "What are you planning to do today?", 
    "And are there any impediments?", 
    "And the idea is as you go around in a group, you can figure out well, if you", 
    "just did that in different orders, I wouldn't be blocked.", 
    "And you can talk that over.", 
    "And it's a short stand-up meeting to do that.", 
    "So that's a big part of the Scrum ideas.", 
    "And we direct you to be able to do that.", 
    "The other question is what the roles are.", 
    "There's the team.", 
    "OK, that's one role.", 
    "Then there's something called the ScrumMaster.", 
    "That somebody who is the team member, who acts as the buffer between the", 
    "team and all the external people, people who want to have", 
    "meetings with you.", 
    "The ScrumMaster handles that.", 
    "Make sure the team's working on the stories you're supposed", 
    "to be working on.", 
    "If you have rules about how you're supposed to do things, the ScrumMaster", 
    "enforces that.", 
    "And anything that's in a way, the computers are too slow.", 
    "OK, that's my job to be able to take care of it.", 
    "The final rule is what's called the Produce Owner.", 
    "And that's the person who acts as the advocate for the customer.", 
    "And that's the person who prioritize the user stories.", 
    "Your pretending to be the customer on that.", 
    "So basically, Scrum is a self-organizing", 
    "small team, daily meetings.", 
    "They work in what's called sprints like in rugby, as opposed to the", 
    "iterations of Agiles.", 
    "So maybe two weeks or four weeks, everybody's already to go and works", 
    "hard for two to four weeks.", 
    "And then they stop and see where they are.", 
    "And the members rotate through that role.", 
    "And Scrum--", 
    "I played rugby--", 
    "when there's a violation, you get together.", 
    "These big mass of people push at each other.", 
    "And that's where there idea's supposed to come from.", 
    "So with that, questions about what's true about Scrum?", 
    "I'll do a quick question.", 
    "Scrum is at it's best when it's difficult to plan ahead.", 
    "Scrum is as good for safety critical software as well as", 
    "software as a service.", 
    "Scrum implies Agile development.", 
    "All of them are true."
