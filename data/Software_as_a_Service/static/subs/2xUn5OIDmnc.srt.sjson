    "Armando Fox: So let's go through them.", 
    "Reduce code complexity.", 
    "Sure, that's one of the main reasons we do refactoring.", 
    "We just did it.", 
    "We both quantitatively and qualitatively confirmed that our", 
    "refactoring has helped achieve that.", 
    "We did, in fact, help eliminate some smells that READ complained about.", 
    "We found a bug but that was more a byproduct of the process than the goal", 
    "of the process so red is the correct answer in this case.", 
    "Finding bugs is great.", 
    "I'm all in favor of it but refactoring is not about bugs.", 
    "It's orthogonal to bugs.", 
    "And in fact, if anything, as I said before, beware the pitfall of trying", 
    "to do the two activities together because you'll basically", 
    "screw them both up.", 
    "And then improving testability, well, to the extent you're reducing code", 
    "complexity and breaking things out into smaller pieces, those pieces do", 
    "tend to be more testable.", 
    "And in the book, there's an example of how part of the example that we just", 
    "did actually helps improve your C0 coverage score because breaking out", 
    "smaller pieces lets you test each piece more thoroughly and it lets you", 
    "boost your coverage to a higher level than would have been possible with the", 
    "one big method at the beginning.", 
    "And there was a question over here.", 
    "Can I define code Complexity?", 
    "No, because there's so many different metrics of it.", 
    "But a couple of different metrics that most people agree have some use, is", 
    "the cyclomatic complexity, which Saikuro measuress, and the ABC", 
    "complexity, which Flog measures.", 
    "Now, again, I'm not presenting those two because they're better than all", 
    "other metrics.", 
    "There's a lot of disagreement about which metrics are most useful, and are", 
    "they more meaningful in certain language than in other", 
    "languages and so forth.", 
    "But in trying to take out two or three that most people agree on, yes, this", 
    "is worth looking at, those are a couple of different measures of", 
    "complexity.", 
    "If you go to the Wikipedia article called \"Software Metrics,\" they list", 
    "like 30 different measures of software complexity.", 
    "And you could make a case for all of them.", 
    "But as usual, there's kind of a tasteful line you have to draw between", 
    "how much you actually do on a given project and where to say, my", 
    "engineering judgment is this is good.", 
    "This feels right to me.", 
    "Yes?", 
    "There's more than one way to cheat, by the way.", 
    "What am I doing here, right?", 
    "The normal mechanism in Ruby is that unless you make something accessible", 
    "with attr underscore accessor, or attr reader attr writer.", 
    "If you don't do one of those things, it's only visible", 
    "inside of its own class.", 
    "So by telling that class to evaluate this statement, I'm", 
    "violating that rule.", 
    "Now my excuse here is the reason I'm violating it is I want to be able to", 
    "test the code more thoroughly without changing the source code.", 
    "But if this actually appeared in an application, you would need a really", 
    "good reason when you're brought up for tribunal on why you're deliberately", 
    "violating the encapsulation of that class.", 
    "So in terms of like syntactic legality, you could do", 
    "it any way you want.", 
    "It's just a bad idea.", 
    "Here's a way to do it without even doing the attr underscore accessor.", 
    "There's a Ruby method instance variable set that will actually let", 
    "you forcibly ram a value down the instance variable's throat.", 
    "And again, if the reason you're doing is you want to test a particular case", 
    "that would be difficult to test otherwise, that's", 
    "a defensible rationale.", 
    "You can do this anywhere in your code, but it is a very poor idea.", 
    "Ruby is like Unix, it gives you enough rope to hang yourself.", 
    "So just be judicious in how you use it.", 
    "But yes, technically you can do it from anywhere.", 
    "If there's such a thing as a takeaway from legacy code and refactoring and", 
    "by the way, we spent a lot of time, relatively speaking, on refactoring,", 
    "both in the lecture and in the book, just because one of the themes that", 
    "comes out of this is refactoring is a main activity that you do, not only in", 
    "legacy code but actually in writing your own code as well.", 
    "So here's my summary of kind of what I take away from refactoring.", 
    "Here's a first draft of a famous document.", 
    "\"When in the course of human events it becomes necessary for a people to", 
    "advance from that subordination in which they have hitherto remained.\"", 
    "it's got no punch whatsoever.", 
    "But when it's revised to \"it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve", 
    "the political bands which have connected them with another.\" That's", 
    "much more forceful.", 
    "This is the first draft.", 
    "And by the way, it really is.", 
    "This is the first draft of the opening of the Declaration of Independence.", 
    "And by the way, the truths are no longer sacred and undeniable, they're", 
    "self-evident.", 
    "Like you're stupid if you don't get them.", 
    "They're self-evident.", 
    "That second draft is always better.", 
    "Refactoring is the second draft of your code.", 
    "Just because the first draft of your code works doesn't mean you should", 
    "necessarily be happy with it.", 
    "You can usually tell.", 
    "There's that little voice inside your head, Jiminy Cricket, that says, your", 
    "code is not [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "It doesn't say that all, actually.", 
    "You can tell when you look at your code if you're proud of it or not.", 
    "You look at it and you go, wow.", 
    "That's beautiful.", 
    "That does just what it needs to do and it's really clear what the designers'", 
    "intent was.", 
    "Or you can look at it and say, you know, that works but I felt like I had", 
    "to do a hack to get something to work.", 
    "Whenever you feel like, oh, I can get that to work but it's", 
    "kind of a hack, stop.", 
    "That is the time to realize that most of your time designing, coding, and", 
    "testing is refactoring time.", 
    "Getting code to work the first time is not nearly as hard as also getting it", 
    "to be in good shape and testable.", 
    "That's kind of an overwhelming philosophy of this class.", 
    "So various variants that sort of oppose this, probably the most common", 
    "one that a lot of us are guilty of is, this code sucks.", 
    "Let's just throw it out and start over.", 
    "How hard can it be?", 
    "And getting the first 80% working usually isn't that hard.", 
    "Have you already talked about the 90/90 rule, Dave?", 
    "That the first 90% of the project takes 90% of the time and the last 10%", 
    "of the project takes the other 90% of the time.", 
    "The 90% you can reproduce quickly is not the problem.", 
    "Right?", 
    "It's all the time that you don't see that went into getting the 10% that's", 
    "often really important to work well.", 
    "There's a lot of knowledge invested in working code.", 
    "Agile is all about have code that works at all times.", 
    "And when you throw something out and decide to start over, you're", 
    "immediately violating that entire premise.", 
    "It's going to be much harder than you think.", 
    "As I've said before, don't confuse refactoring with bug fixing or with", 
    "other enhancements.", 
    "When you're going to fix something that's ugly, focus on that one part of", 
    "the code, fix that one refactoring, test it, and then move on.", 
    "Don't fix up stuff along the way because you're sure it'll make the", 
    "code better and it won't break anything.", 
    "It always does.", 
    "Abuse of metrics.", 
    "Just as with testing, don't get hung up on how low can I make", 
    "my complexity numbers.", 
    "Metrics are there to sort of tell you when you're clearly going", 
    "in the wrong direction.", 
    "They can't give you a guarantee that you're necessarily at your goal.", 
    "There's a certain amount of engineering taste and judgment that", 
    "you learn to exercise and you can tell by yourself when you've gotten there.", 
    "And sort of a corollary of a lot of these is the longer you put off", 
    "refactoring, the more painful it is in a non-linear way.", 
    "Doing a refactoring of one class now is much less painful when that class", 
    "has fewer external connections and fewer external dependencies.", 
    "Waiting a long time and then saying, well at the end of the year we're", 
    "going to refactor our app, it's going to be way worse than spending a little", 
    "time each week fixing it where it really needs to be fixed.", 
    "So keep metrics turned on.", 
    "Be aware of what's the metrics are trying to tell you and don't", 
    "get hung up on it.", 
    "So those are my fallacies and pitfalls and we could conclude this section by", 
    "asking which is true regarding refactoring, given this.", 
    "That it usually results in more concise code, like fewer lines?", 
    "That it should not cause existing tests to fail?", 
    "That it addresses explicit customer requirements as", 
    "opposed to implicit ones?", 
    "And that it often result in changes to the test suite?", 
    "Exactly one of these is true."
