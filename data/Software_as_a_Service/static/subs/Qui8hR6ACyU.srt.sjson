    "JESSIE: Alright.", 
    "So a little bit about me.", 
    "I think you guys are using Pivotal Tracker for your projects.", 
    "Awesome.", 
    "So I worked at Pivotal Labs when I first left Berkeley for 1 year and a", 
    "half, 2 years.", 
    "How much do you guys know about Pivotal Labs?", 
    "Did somebody from there come talk to you, give you the whole spiel?", 
    "OK, so you know that they do consulting work.", 
    "So that's what I did when I was there.", 
    "I worked on 7 or 8 different projects over the course of the time that was", 
    "there, so about 3 or 4 months per project.", 
    "And I got to do a lot of Rails work, lot of JavaScript work.", 
    "I did one project that was purely backbone written against somebody's", 
    "API, did an Android app.", 
    "So I got to experience a lot of different things.", 
    "But mainly what I did was Rails.", 
    "And I got to see some old Rails apps that had huge amount of code.", 
    "I got to start a few brand new Rails apps from scratch.", 
    "So I got to see things across the spectrum.", 
    "And I feel like that experience is really, really valuable.", 
    "I got to learn a lot of things that I may not have learned if I went to a", 
    "company where they already had a code base and I was just working", 
    "in that code base.", 
    "Yes.", 
    "STUDENT: How did you like the pair programming?", 
    "JESSIE: I liked the pair programming a lot.", 
    "I would recommend that if you can possibly stand it, you should go to a", 
    "place that does pair programming when you come right out because you will", 
    "learn so much faster than if you were to just stumble", 
    "through it on your own.", 
    "When you start at Pivotal, at least when I started there, they would pair", 
    "you up with another Pivot exclusively for about 3 months, at least, to get", 
    "you up to speed.", 
    "And I think that creates tremendous growth and a great learning", 
    "opportunity.", 
    "And the more you pair, the more you'll learn.", 
    "I think that you'll probably get to a point where you're not learning as", 
    "much by pairing.", 
    "And that's the point where you switch over and you start teaching the person", 
    "that you're pairing with.", 
    "And I think that's also valuable, too, because once you start teaching, you", 
    "will really solidify your knowledge.", 
    "You'll realize how little you know about the thing you're trying to teach", 
    "because you're trying to explain it to someone.", 
    "You're like, actually, I have no idea how that works.", 
    "Let's figure it out.", 
    "So I think pairing sounds scary.", 
    "I think the biggest thing that people are afraid of is that they think that", 
    "they'll look dumb, the other person will think they're dumb.", 
    "I would recommend that if you're afraid of that, don't worry about it.", 
    "Don't think about it.", 
    "Everybody feels dumb when they first start pairing.", 
    "And I think paired programming teaches you to lose your ego, because I think", 
    "thinking that you're going to look dumb is your ego.", 
    "You want to be this egotistical programmer.", 
    "You want to be the greatest guy.", 
    "You want to be the ninja rock star or whatever.", 
    "But once you learn to lose that, you'll learn a lot more.", 
    "You'll be able to say what you don't know, which makes it easier for you to", 
    "learn what you don't know.", 
    "As soon as you say, I have no idea how that works, then you'll just go and", 
    "figure it out.", 
    "And it won't be a big deal.", 
    "So they have lots of pairing at Pivotal Labs, cool projects.", 
    "Recently, I think in August, I left Pivotal and I moved over to", 
    "ModCloth.com.", 
    "They were somebody who was a client that worked with Pivotal.", 
    "So they're very similar to Pivotal in that respect.", 
    "But they're are a product company.", 
    "So they sell vintage style dresses online.", 
    "It's also Rails development.", 
    "It's similar to what I was doing there, but working for a company", 
    "itself rather than consulting for other companies.", 
    "So I talked about this a little bit with your question.", 
    "But this is the sort of thing I did at Pivotal.", 
    "This is the other sort of thing I do at ModCloth.", 
    "Any company that does extreme programming, as they call it, this is", 
    "what you'll end up with.", 
    "You'll do pair programming.", 
    "You'll do agile--", 
    "there's different brands of agile, but I think the one that Pivotal does,", 
    "that style is a much leaner agile.", 
    "I know there's Scrum, which is very official and a little more weighty.", 
    "You'll also do test-driven or behavior-driven development.", 
    "I don't know how much you guys know about that.", 
    "You probably had a little lecture on it.", 
    "But if you were to work at one of these companies, you would", 
    "learn a lot about it.", 
    "So I want to give you an idea of the day in the life of this agile, or", 
    "maybe a week in the life of this thing.", 
    "So this is what I did at Pivotal.", 
    "This is what I do at ModCloth, also.", 
    "You start off--", 
    "if you're going to do something new, you do what we called an inception,", 
    "which is figure out what your goals are in the project, get together the", 
    "note cards.", 
    "You guys probably learned about writing out user", 
    "stories on note cards.", 
    "We actually do that, post them on the wall.", 
    "Put those into Pivotal Tracker.", 
    "And then you start the cycle that goes around like this in a week.", 
    "So at the beginning of a week, you plan out what work you want to get", 
    "done in the next iteration, so iteration planning meeting.", 
    "You prioritize that in Tracker.", 
    "You give it points to estimate how much relative work you think it's", 
    "going to be compared to the other stories.", 
    "And then you're ready to start coding on it.", 
    "So you do a standup every day and let people know what your progress is, if", 
    "you're running into things that you can't solve.", 
    "Maybe you need a little bit of help or a little more clarification on things.", 
    "That's what that's for.", 
    "You pair during the day.", 
    "A lot of the projects that I worked on at Pivotal, we'd do pair rotations.", 
    "So you're pairing with someone.", 
    "But you switch around who you're pairing with basically every day.", 
    "That way, you don't get sick of the guy next to you.", 
    "And then, of course, you code.", 
    "And you repeat that daily.", 
    "And depending on your iteration, at the end of the week, or maybe every", 
    "day, you might deploy the new code that you've created.", 
    "Usually, at the end of the iteration, you'll do a retrospective, which is", 
    "like everybody gets in a room, and sits down, and talks about what went", 
    "well and what went wrong.", 
    "And the last thing, in the last iteration, I think these are pretty", 
    "important to figure out the pain points, or the things in your process", 
    "that are really nasty, that you don't like, and try to fix", 
    "them the next time.", 
    "I think if you go to a place that does this sort of thing, you'll probably", 
    "have a good day-to-day experience working, because if you can talk", 
    "honestly in a retrospective about the things that you hate in your code", 
    "base, then that means you can probably fix them.", 
    "And you won't hate them anymore for too long.", 
    "So part of that little thing was coding.", 
    "And I mentioned that we do test-driven development.", 
    "We did it at Pivotal.", 
    "And we do it at ModCloth.", 
    "Well, a lot places that do TDD, they're pretty extreme about it.", 
    "If you do TDD-- most places do TDD all the time.", 
    "So they say you should test every line of code you're writing.", 
    "Or maybe they say something like two lines of test for every", 
    "line of code you write.", 
    "And that's what I've done at Pivotal.", 
    "That's what I do at ModCloth.", 
    "It's a very specific opinion in software development.", 
    "Not everybody shares that opinion.", 
    "But I think it's a great thing.", 
    "I think that if you do TDD, which is--", 
    "TDD usually means test first.", 
    "So lots of people can write tests afterwards and still get the same sort", 
    "of coverage.", 
    "But what we did was test first, which is--", 
    "you write the test.", 
    "You watch it fail.", 
    "You write the code to make it pass.", 
    "Maybe you go back and refactor the code.", 
    "I know you guys have probably heard the red green refactor thing.", 
    "So that's what we would do.", 
    "But I think it's pretty useful, because it helps you to design your", 
    "code a little better.", 
    "If you're trying to write a test and it's taking you an hour to write the", 
    "test and 20 lines to set it up, then you probably know that your code is", 
    "going to end up pretty bad, too.", 
    "So it gives you a chance to write things in a cleaner style, refactor", 
    "things, work into smaller chunks so that you can move faster.", 
    "It's easier to change things whenever they need changed.", 
    "And whenever things go wrong, you have a test there telling you what's", 
    "supposed to happen so you can easily diagnose it.", 
    "Tests are great documentation for your code.", 
    "So I encourage you all to do TDD.", 
    "And I'm sure you guys have probably worked with Rspec and a", 
    "little bit of Cucumber.", 
    "I don't know if you guys have done Jasmine at all.", 
    "But whatever language you're in, there is a testing framework.", 
    "So I encourage you to do TDD, even if you're not doing Rails or Ruby.", 
    "So I said that I was a full stack developer.", 
    "And I wanted to talk a little bit about what that meant.", 
    "I know I had said, try to be general and don't specialize.", 
    "And I think I've done that so far in my career.", 
    "I've stayed what we in Rails call full stack.", 
    "So I'm writing the Rails code.", 
    "I'm writing the views, controllers, models.", 
    "I'm writing the JavaScript.", 
    "I write stuff on the back end, our deployment scripts, things like that.", 
    "I touch pretty much everything in the code base.", 
    "And it's given me a good, well-rounded foundation.", 
    "And I think it will allow me to--", 
    "I think I'm starting to specialize a little bit now.", 
    "But I think full stack is really a good thing to do, because you will", 
    "understand everything.", 
    "There won't be a line where you say, OK, I have to hand this off to this", 
    "other engineer.", 
    "And he'll figure it out.", 
    "And then he'll give it back to me.", 
    "And if something goes wrong, we have to figure out what happened between", 
    "us, because there's this other code that I didn't write, and I don't", 
    "understand, because I don't do that.", 
    "That's not my thing.", 
    "Full stack means whatever it is, you figure it out.", 
    "And if it's not something that you know, then learn it.", 
    "And I think that's a great style and a great philosophy, because like I said,", 
    "there won't be an end to your knowledge.", 
    "You'll be able to understand everything, debug everything.", 
    "And hopefully, once you understand how all the systems work together, you can", 
    "write better code in all the places."
