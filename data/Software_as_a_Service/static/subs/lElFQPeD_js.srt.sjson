    "ARMANDO FOX: So this next section, we're going to talk about the", 
    "deployment environment and things to actually worry", 
    "about once you've deployed.", 
    "So far all you've really had to worry about is whether it's deployed enough", 
    "for the auto graders to say you passed, but in real life there's a", 
    "great many things you care--", 
    "deployment is sort of like the beginning of an adventure.", 
    "Right?", 
    "Like graduation.", 
    "Deployment is when you actually have to start worrying about stuff that", 
    "you've taken for granted all along.", 
    "It's pretty grim when you think about it.", 
    "OK, so here's an outline of topics that we're going to cover that--", 
    "so how do we pull this outline of topics together?", 
    "Because, again, as you guys know, there are people who make their entire", 
    "careers in doing operations, development, systems administration at", 
    "a very high level for enormous clusters.", 
    "So we actually went and talked to people who work in companies that are", 
    "sort of at the boundary of development and operations.", 
    "Heroku, Pivotal Labs, Amazon and so forth.", 
    "And there is a certain set of things that even if you yourselves never have", 
    "as your primary function to be the operators of a site, as a developer", 
    "there are things you have to know.", 
    "Because your design, as a developer of your application, is going to impact", 
    "operations in those ways.", 
    "So the topics that we're going to talk about really focus on those.", 
    "What are the things that you as app developers and maintainers have to", 
    "know that will make your apps deployable and operable", 
    "in a pleasant way.", 
    "So we're going to talk about continuous integration, which has now", 
    "evolved into continuous deployment in terms of software as a service.", 
    "Upgrades and feature flags.", 
    "This is something that, if you're doing software not as a service, this", 
    "just doesn't even arise, right?", 
    "If you want to upgrade it you just say, hey, an update is available.", 
    "Would like to spend 10 minutes downloading it now?", 
    "But you can't really do that online.", 
    "You've got to do the updates without having the site", 
    "really go down for anybody.", 
    "So it's kind of like changing the tires on a car at 80 miles an hour.", 
    "So how do you do that?", 
    "Availability and responsiveness.", 
    "Everybody agrees they're good, but how do you measure them, what are they and", 
    "what is good, exactly?", 
    "Are there agreed upon thresholds for measuring how good is good enough?", 
    "Monitoring.", 
    "How do you know when stuff goes wrong?", 
    "Notice that I didn't say how do you know if stuff goes wrong.", 
    "Because it for sure will.", 
    "It's how do you know when stuff goes wrong, and more importantly, how do", 
    "you pinpoint what made it go wrong so you can actually do", 
    "something about it.", 
    "As an app developer there are some things you can do that", 
    "are very, very bad.", 
    "You can do stupid, stupid things in terms of how you use the database.", 
    "Things that are so stupid that the world's best database administrator", 
    "will not be able to save you.", 
    "So what are some common mistakes that put too much pressure on your database", 
    "and artificially limit your scalability when otherwise you could", 
    "have been doing much better.", 
    "How do you prevent evil people from getting a customer's data?", 
    "It's becoming harder and harder to do.", 
    "But one answer is don't store their data.", 
    "We'll talk about that as one of the options.", 
    "So far, most of what we've done in the course has concentrated on the", 
    "development phase of your project.", 
    "Right?", 
    "What happens up until the moment you push it out, and pretty much what that", 
    "means is how do you design and test your app to make sure that it works", 
    "the way you expect and the way that your customer wanted.", 
    "Deployment is totally different.", 
    "Now what you're worried about is, given that your app works as designed", 
    "when in development mode, what happens when it is used in ways that you", 
    "didn't design it to be used?", 
    "What happens if it's under higher load than you ever expected?", 
    "What happens if people throw random data at it?", 
    "What happens if users deliberately try to circumvent some of the protections", 
    "you've put in place for customer data?", 
    "The bad news about doing this is that unfortunately we have users.", 
    "Your app would be more stable if nobody ever used it.", 
    "So, unfortunately, the stimulus of having lots of users will cause you a", 
    "great deal of pain.", 
    "Because there are some bugs that only appear under a lot of stress.", 
    "In other words, with a light user load they won't happen.", 
    "But with a heavy user load you'll start to see behaviors that you did", 
    "not test for.", 
    "If there's any ways that your production environment differs from", 
    "your development environment, those are potential places where bugs can", 
    "creep in because they're things that you could not have tested for.", 
    "As we all know, the world is full of evil forces who are out to get your", 
    "data or use your app as a distribution point for malware.", 
    "And the world is full of well well-intentioned people who just use", 
    "your app in an improper way.", 
    "They upload large binary files, when really what you were expecting was a", 
    "small text file, or something like that.", 
    "So deployment is worrying about how to detect and recover", 
    "from things like this.", 
    "The good news, to counter the bad news, is that compared to even 10", 
    "years ago, the deployment part of your job as a SaaS developer is way more", 
    "pleasant than it used to be.", 
    "The way it used to be, and the way many people still do it now, although", 
    "in my opinion, they really shouldn't, is you sign up to get a VPS--", 
    "a virtual private server.", 
    "Maybe it's in the Cloud, maybe it's in some fly-by-night data center you've", 
    "never heard of.", 
    "You install and configure the world.", 
    "You've got to install a million things just to sort of get", 
    "your app off the ground.", 
    "You fix almost weekly security vulnerabilities.", 
    "In fact, I wanted to show you guys a list just so you get a sense--", 
    "so this is a couple of years ago I guess.", 
    "This was a scan I had done on an application that I had-- it's the one", 
    "that I've been using for all these examples.", 
    "Right?", 
    "And if it takes people's money, so there's reason to make sure that", 
    "things are OK.", 
    "And it used to be the way that credit cards work is you were required to run", 
    "a vulnerability scan every three months.", 
    "And if you pass the scan then you were good to go, right?", 
    "So this is the result of the first ever vulnerability scan that I ran", 
    "thinking, well, I installed the latest version of everything, I compiled", 
    "everything clean from the sources, I've turned off", 
    "all unnecessary services.", 
    "I should be good, right?", 
    "This is page one of 25.", 
    "I have an SSL shared cipher buffer overflow vulnerability.", 
    "A score of 10 means this is something where a person who knows how to", 
    "exploit this can take over your machine permanently.", 
    "What else?", 
    "Oh.", 
    "A bad version Oracle side channel attack vulnerability.", 
    "This is like random words put together, right?", 
    "And where is it?", 
    "It's in the open SSL library.", 
    "It's not even in an application.", 
    "It's in a library that everything in the world depends on.", 
    "So if you recompile that library, you also have to recompile and relink", 
    "Apache, MySQL, SSHD, everything, right?", 
    "I could go on.", 
    "But you get the idea.", 
    "Some of these are unbelievably obscure.", 
    "But even the ones that are not obscure are just a pain.", 
    "So that's how the world used to be.", 
    "And you'd do that like every three months.", 
    "And, by the way, despite the fact that open SSL has been around for years,", 
    "vulnerabilities are still being discovered in it, right?", 
    "People find new ways to attack it.", 
    "And if you actually cared about performance, you'd also have to do", 
    "some tuning to make sure that you weren't paying for more service than", 
    "you needed.", 
    "And if you were on the Cloud, and you wanted to do some horizontal scaling,", 
    "you'd have to figure out how to do that part too.", 
    "Today we've switched largely to using platform as a service deployment, like", 
    "you all are doing with Heroku.", 
    "And the nice thing about this is that they have people managing these", 
    "aspects who are much better at it than you.", 
    "That's what it comes down to.", 
    "Right?", 
    "There are people whose entire job is to worry about", 
    "reliability and security.", 
    "And, yes, I know Heroku just had an outage.", 
    "And, yes, I know it's not the first outage that they've ever had.", 
    "But, overall, if you compare their uptime and their reliability as a", 
    "deployment platform with what most people are able to do themselves, you", 
    "would rather have your app on something like Heroku.", 
    "So that means that, largely, our advice to people starting out in SaaS,", 
    "is stick with this for as long as possible.", 
    "If you can keep your application in the tier that is well handled by", 
    "platform as a service, you can avoid handling--", 
    "what do you do in terms of horizontal scaling?", 
    "How do you tune the performance of the individual components?", 
    "Is your database tuned in the best way?", 
    "Well, how about if a database expert was actually able to handle that", 
    "question instead.", 
    "So as a developer what do you still have to do?", 
    "You still have to write your app in a way that treats the database nicely.", 
    "There are things that you can do, like caching, to minimize the load that", 
    "your app that's on the rest of the infrastructure.", 
    "There are certain things you can do to avoid your application leaking data or", 
    "compromising data.", 
    "But it's a much smaller set of stuff that you have to worry about, and a", 
    "lot more of it is under your direct control as the app developer.", 
    "So is this really feasible?", 
    "Is it really true that a nontrivially large app can stay in the PaaS service", 
    "here before you outgrow it?", 
    "Well, Pivotal Tracker is one PaaS instance.", 
    "Right?", 
    "So Pivotal Tracker runs on a single large database and a bunch", 
    "of front end nodes.", 
    "If you've used Basecamp, which is a project management software as a", 
    "service based project management, that runs on a single database.", 
    "And there's a lot of applications that are not world-facing.", 
    "If you're building an application for internal use by, for example, a", 
    "company or a department within a company, those apps are not", 
    "necessarily going to have millions of users.", 
    "They might have thousands, or a few tens of thousands of users.", 
    "And a lot of those are well within the scale that would fit in a PaaS", 
    "environment.", 
    "And what we're going to find is that even if you do outgrow the PaaS", 
    "environment, the kinds of problems you'll have to solve are the same ones", 
    "that if you solve them early will keep you in the PaaS environment longer.", 
    "So you'll sort of get a preview, a dry run, of how to solve them.", 
    "So if we're going to talk about performance and security, let's agree", 
    "on what they are.", 
    "There's various terms we're going to use.", 
    "Availability or up time is the one that you read about most in the news.", 
    "The simple version of this is what percentage of the time is the site up", 
    "and accessible?", 
    "The more subtle version is actually computed with a variety of parameters.", 
    "We'll show an example of how you compute it and how people in the", 
    "industry actually measure it.", 
    "Responsiveness.", 
    "Basically, how long after you click do you get a response from the server?", 
    "Do you get some visual acknowledgement that something happened?", 
    "And what are the different components of that, and how do you measure it", 
    "over an entire app that has many different page views.", 
    "Scalability is a term that means many things to many people, but in SaaS it", 
    "means something very particular, which is as the number of users increases,", 
    "can I maintain the same responsiveness without increasing the cost per user?", 
    "Not the overall cost, but the cost per user.", 
    "Right?", 
    "So basically, what it means is that if the cost to serve a given user is", 
    "fixed, or even better if it's going down, then adding more users makes me", 
    "more money.", 
    "If the cost of serving more users increases as the number of users goes", 
    "up, then that's bad.", 
    "Because at some point that's going cross my curve of making money.", 
    "I'm going to start to lose money.", 
    "Privacy usually means is access to data limited to people who are", 
    "authorized to access it?", 
    "And that can be a tricky question depending on what authorization means.", 
    "And authentication, which we've already gotten an introduction to, is", 
    "can we believe that the user is who they say they are?", 
    "Which is separate from authorization, and therefore, separate from privacy.", 
    "And lastly, data integrity, which is if somebody tampers with the user's", 
    "data, would we be able to tell?", 
    "So we're going to refer to the top group of these as performance", 
    "stability, or performance related aspects of operations.", 
    "And the bottom three as security related aspects of operations.", 
    "Let's start with just a simple conceptual thing.", 
    "Assuming that, in terms of availability, more", 
    "availability is better.", 
    "It means that it's available a larger fraction of the time.", 
    "If I have the availability of four things--", 
    "I have RottenPotatoes running on Heroku, and I access the internet", 
    "through my Comcast home internet connection.", 
    "So I have a certain perception, end to end, of the availability of", 
    "RottenPotatoes, and which of those statements describes it?", 
    "Or do all three of them describe it?"
