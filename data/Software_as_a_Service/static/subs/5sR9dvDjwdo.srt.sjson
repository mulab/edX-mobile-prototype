    "DAVID PATTERSON: So let's go over them.", 
    "I don't think we need to vote again.", 
    "When compared to teams, the ones with a higher velocity is more productive,", 
    "no, every team has their own points.", 
    "They're assigning it.", 
    "And maybe they're more conservative, one team more liberal--", 
    "as long as it's consistent.", 
    "Now you can look over time and see if a given team is less productive,", 
    "sometimes, then more productive, since they are assigning themselves points.", 
    "So within a team, you might be able to see things, and maybe you'd figure out", 
    "something that was a distraction.", 
    "Yeah, when you don't know, just give it three points.", 
    "That's not the way it's supposed to work.", 
    "You're supposed to know, all right?", 
    "You're supposed to reach consensus--", 
    "how many points it is.", 
    "If you don't know, then you need to talk about it more or define it more.", 
    "With Tracker the developers pick the user's stories and mark it accepted--", 
    "it's the product owner who makes the final decision about whether", 
    "it's done or not.", 
    "So somebody is the customer advocate, and that product", 
    "owner makes that decision.", 
    "And the last one is correct.", 
    "That's what Tracker does.", 
    "OK, next step.", 
    "Code reviews and design reviews.", 
    "So what are those things?", 
    "You may have heard about them before.", 
    "A design review is where the people creating the software get together and", 
    "talk about the design.", 
    "It's kind of like BDD versus TDD here, right?", 
    "And the reason that people get together and go over the design is", 
    "particularly for less-experienced people to benefit from the experience", 
    "of the more experienced people, right, is share that.", 
    "So design reviews can have this educational component to that, kind of", 
    "like pair programming.", 
    "You can learn from the person about the company and about new ideas in", 
    "programming or good and bad ways to do things.", 
    "Well, that's kind of the purpose of a design review.", 
    "And then there's also a code review, is so places will", 
    "have also code reviews.", 
    "So once you've actually start implementing it, people will look over", 
    "your code and give you feedback on it.", 
    "Now these ideas were around before the Agile life cycle was invented.", 
    "And since the Agile, kind of Scrum model is you design implementation", 
    "together they don't quite fit in as naturally as they do in the waterfall", 
    "or spiral models.", 
    "So you might do it every few iterations.", 
    "And we'll say what Pivotal Labs does as an example.", 
    "Now because designing and code reviews are actually very widespread--", 
    "one thing that I read about design reviews, this person Shalloway, he", 
    "thinks they often are this big process that a lot of big companies go through", 
    "and spend a lot of energy, but it's usually too late to have any impact.", 
    "So he recommends instead having smaller groups with this mixture of", 
    "experiences, so the people could benefit from it, of approach reviews", 
    "there's a little bit smaller group that you would do before you do the", 
    "formal design review or code review that, maybe, companies may require.", 
    "We talked, like I just said a few minutes ago, that one of the things I", 
    "love about the course is, for everything we tell you to", 
    "do, there's a tool.", 
    "And if you remember, I talked about Osterhout's advice about doing", 
    "comments, that you should document what's not obvious from the code,", 
    "raise the level of abstraction, and then, particularly, explain why you're", 
    "doing something.", 
    "Because it's hard to figure out why from looking at the code.", 
    "The problem is, we don't have a tool to check that.", 
    "Until natural language processing gets a lot better, it's going to be hard to", 
    "check if the comments agree with the code.", 
    "So what mechanism do we have?", 
    "Code reviews.", 
    "So code reviews is a place where you can--", 
    "people are reading your code, they can look at the comments and see if the", 
    "changes you've made or the refactoring, or you're just", 
    "documenting the code, i equals i plus 1, or you're actually", 
    "putting down the wire.", 
    "They could ask questions, you don't explain why you do this, write this", 
    "down in the code.", 
    "So this is the one advantage of it.", 
    "The one other thing about doing design reviews is design reviews and code", 
    "reviews, they have meetings--", 
    "so at just about every company I've visited, they have advice on how to", 
    "run good meetings.", 
    "So once you graduate from Berkeley, you're going to spend a", 
    "lot of time in meetings.", 
    "And a lot of meetings are poorly run.", 
    "So Armando and I came up with an unforgettable acronym--", 
    "SAMOSAS.", 
    "[LAUGH]", 
    "Well, I came up with it.", 
    "Full credit.", 
    "It's a little bit long, it's too many letters.", 
    "I wish I'd come up with only a five letter acronym.", 
    "But all right.", 
    "And so since, kind of, one of the benefits of being an author is you", 
    "learn new stuff, and then you use it.", 
    "So since we came up with the acronym, we've been using it in our meetings,", 
    "particularly, we've got a meeting with 10 people who are trying to do work in", 
    "cancer genomics.", 
    "And we follow these guidelines, and it's made the meetings much more", 
    "productive.", 
    "So S--", 
    "what is that?", 
    "The first S--", 
    "Start and stop promptly.", 
    "So a lot of meetings, like, there's this Berkeley time--", 
    "when do things start?", 
    "Well, it is 11:00, 11:10--", 
    "for us, it's 11:10.", 
    "And it's going to be over by noon.", 
    "And we stop before noon.", 
    "So it starts and stops--", 
    "that way people show up in time, and they'll be there.", 
    "To avoid this confusion, because 10 sounds like they rounded it, right?", 
    "So scrums will often be, like, 10:08.", 
    "It's hard to argue 10:08 is 10:09 or 10:07.", 
    "No, it's 10:08, right?", 
    "Just so that you know it really starts and then everybody's supposed to be", 
    "there then, you start promptly.", 
    "The A part is for an agenda.", 
    "You're supposed to have an agenda for a meeting, written in advance,", 
    "distributed to people.", 
    "And you know what, if you don't, there's no agenda for that meeting,", 
    "cancel the meeting.", 
    "Everybody could use the time.", 
    "So there needs to be an agenda.", 
    "Kind of going along with the M part of it, going along with having agenda is,", 
    "minutes are recorded so that everyone can recall the results.", 
    "So one of the worst things about being a faculty member is having these", 
    "faculty meetings where we talk, and talk, and talk, and", 
    "nothing gets resolved.", 
    "And it was a waste of time.", 
    "So somebody writes down the minutes, see what happens, so that we can see", 
    "what people are supposed to do afterwards.", 
    "And if you missed the meeting, you can see what happened.", 
    "Alas, I don't know if it's just limited to computer science, but", 
    "that's what my life has been.", 
    "We certainly have embraced the rude speaker model.", 
    "Somehow, the person who speaks the fastest, fills all the emptyness with", 
    "words, is the smartest or something, right?", 
    "And you just wait for somebody to take a small breath, and then cut in, don't", 
    "let them finish.", 
    "So that's not the way to run a meeting.", 
    "You're supposed to let people finish their thought, not interrupt them", 
    "two-thirds of the way through a sentence.", 
    "So one person at a time, and they get to actually finish", 
    "what they're saying.", 
    "Send material in advance.", 
    "The meeting time is precious.", 
    "You can read a lot faster than you can listen.", 
    "So send materials in advance so people can read them.", 
    "And you expect people to have read the material before the meeting starts.", 
    "Action items at the end of the meeting.", 
    "I always think I first heard of that one at Intel, action items.", 
    "That's, I think, where it comes from.", 
    "But as a result of having the meeting, there's supposed to be something", 
    "that's happening.", 
    "And so these so-called action items, you would write down what's supposed", 
    "to happen, who's supposed to do it.", 
    "And then at the end of the meeting, you'll go over, what're the action", 
    "items as a result of this meeting, who is supposed to do that.", 
    "And then at the beginning of the next meeting, as you look at the minutes,", 
    "well, Sally was supposed to do this in, and Harry was supposed do that--", 
    "what happened, right?", 
    "So people are accountable for the action items and do that.", 
    "And then Set the time and that's the last S is, maybe the meeting's every", 
    "week, but make sure we know when the next meeting is, or maybe you're going", 
    "to move the meetings and stuff like that.", 
    "So that's SAMOSAS.", 
    "All right, so this is actually, again, common sense.", 
    "And probably, this stuff will be useful your whole career.", 
    "So if you do meetings, run them this way, people like your meetings.", 
    "Wow, it started on time, and it was over when I wanted, and", 
    "we got a lot done.", 
    "And people said they do things, and they had to do them.", 
    "So you follow SAMOSAS, you'll have much less time in meetings, or the", 
    "meetings will be more productive.", 
    "OK, reviews in Agile.", 
    "So Pivotal Labs, they today believe in pair programming.", 
    "They are a pair programming shop.", 
    "So they think that we do reviews continuously, 8 hours a day, so", 
    "they're don't do it.", 
    "GitHub, which is another place where we might have a speaker, what they do", 
    "is instead of code reviews every month, they do pull", 
    "requests every day.", 
    "So you're done, you ask your code to be integrated with the code base, you", 
    "issue a pull request.", 
    "The rest of the team looks at the new code, and see how that interacts, how", 
    "it will effect them immediately, at the time of the pull request, that", 
    "leads to an online discussion--", 
    "I'm concerned about these issues.", 
    "And it happens.", 
    "So the this is that what they do instead of a code review.", 
    "So it's kind lots of mini code reviews per day.", 
    "OK, so that's design reviews and reviews.", 
    "And ready for what's true about design review and meetings.", 
    "Which one of these false?", 
    "It's intended to improve the quality of the software product using the", 
    "wisdom of the attendees--", 
    "design reviews.", 
    "They result in technical information exchange and can be highly educational", 
    "for junior people.", 
    "Design reviews can be beneficial to both presenters and attendees.", 
    "Serving food like Samosas leads to good meetings."
