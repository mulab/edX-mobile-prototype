    "Thanks for having me.", 
    "I've been at Pivotal about four and a half years now.", 
    "I've been on dozens of projects, worked with a bunch of interns--", 
    "including Omer, who decided to show up because he's brown-nosing me a little", 
    "bit so I could write a rec for him--", 
    "but I work with JS a lot.", 
    "I used to be horribly, horribly afraid of JavaScript.", 
    "Beat my head against it much the way Armando just mentioned.", 
    "But it turns out it's tame-able.", 
    "And hopefully I can take you through a lot of intro sort of survey stuff.", 
    "We'll get into the nitty gritty.", 
    "And kind of what JS means in a Rails app today, like the ones I'm working", 
    "on, or would be working on if I were billing on my client", 
    "project right now.", 
    "So, yes, definitely please ask questions.", 
    "I'm going to try to chunk this up.", 
    "We'll see how it goes.", 
    "So first, why JavaScript, right?", 
    "Why is this crazy language that has nothing to do with Java in my browser", 
    "and why do I have to worry about it when I'm writing web apps?", 
    "So let's talk about what your app is, right.", 
    "You guys are all working on Rails apps right now, right?", 
    "What are you doing all day every day on your controllers, right?", 
    "You're serving out a static block of HTML, right?", 
    "This could be a Word doc, right, for all we know, right?", 
    "Yeah, OK, you're responding to a URL, you're doing some database queries,", 
    "you're building up some strings, but at the end of the day what you're", 
    "doing, you're serving up a document that's going to be in a browser.", 
    "It's not that exciting.", 
    "Yes, great, it provides information.", 
    "But that's kind of the web circa 15 years ago, right?", 
    "What if we want to do something a little more", 
    "interesting with this document?", 
    "And how do we do that?", 
    "Well that's where we need JavaScript and the DOM API's, right-- document", 
    "object model APIs.", 
    "Anytime you want to do anything interesting at all beyond that static,", 
    "this is what you're going to use.", 
    "Let's take Flash out of the way.", 
    "Let's take Java applets out of the way.", 
    "Those are all passe.", 
    "This is what we're going to use now.", 
    "And you might be saying to yourself in this class--", 
    "you probably learned Ruby, you probably learned some SQL, maybe some", 
    "CSS, maybe some CSS pre-processing.", 
    "Why the heck do you have to learn yet another language?", 
    "I definitely was this way a couple years ago.", 
    "And the thing is that Brendan Eich and the guys at Netscape a few years ago", 
    "gave us this programmatic interface that then sort of propagated across", 
    "all the browsers that people are people using so that we", 
    "can enhance the page.", 
    "So this is what we have to work with.", 
    "For better for worse, this is what we can do with it.", 
    "But what can we do?", 
    "So I've got some examples.", 
    "These are in the-- these URLs are in here for us to look at.", 
    "I'm not making any political affiliations today at all.", 
    "But I just want to show you that if you were the Democratic National", 
    "Committee and wanted to make fun of Romney and his tax plan, you might put", 
    "this page up and then when you mouse over the button it might move.", 
    "And then what's neat is, eventually we get a whole bunch of other things up", 
    "here, right?", 
    "We get our Twitter and Facebook and email links, and of course the", 
    "ubiquitous donation link.", 
    "All that happened with JS, really simple.", 
    "This is actually a fun page to go look at and see what they're doing.", 
    "Another fun one, neat things that you can do--", 
    "xkcd readers?", 
    "Right?", 
    "Yes?", 
    "All right, awesome.", 
    "Does everybody remember this one from a few weeks ago?", 
    "OK.", 
    "Did you go all the way?", 
    "It's way too big, right?", 
    "It's gargantuan.", 
    "What's fun, though?", 
    "Go look at this-- open up the DOM inspector in Chrome or Safari or open", 
    "it up in Firebug.", 
    "And drag this and watch what's going on.", 
    "We'll get to Ajax in a little bit.", 
    "But all that, right, this is Randall saying I need a little more than that", 
    "little pane that I work with every week--", 
    "several times every week.", 
    "This is all JS.", 
    "Little CSS tricks and some background loading of images,", 
    "but click and drag--", 
    "that's JavaScript.", 
    "And here's my favorite.", 
    "Has anybody looked at-- did anybody see the story about this online?", 
    "Watch that.", 
    "Let's watch this.", 
    "This is going to slide and unlock.", 
    "That is not done with images.", 
    "That is done with JavaScript decoding bitmaps and drawing", 
    "them onto the page.", 
    "it's crazy.", 
    "There's another link in the presentation about how they", 
    "actually did it.", 
    "If you want to get really geeky with JS and canvas tags and", 
    "HTML5 it's a fun read.", 
    "This, too-- real time.", 
    "As soon as you scroll down to these, the earpods start spinning and then", 
    "you can click with them.", 
    "And I think you can come muck with them a little bit.", 
    "Anyway, all that's JavaScript, right?", 
    "So if you want to do something really cool within that static block of HTML,", 
    "JS is your friend.", 
    "Make sure to go look at this link.", 
    "So how do you learn JS?", 
    "We have these things out after school called O'Reilly books.", 
    "I think you call them textbooks.", 
    "This book is what you used to get handed any time anybody said, oh you", 
    "need to learn JavaScript.", 
    "Here's the book, right.", 
    "Here's their rhino book.", 
    "You're gonna learn JS, start with that.", 
    "Has anybody ever opened this book, ever seen it, ever strained their back", 
    "picking it up?", 
    "Let me help you out.", 
    "These are the two things you need to know about this book.", 
    "If you want to do anything to interact on the page you're going to use some", 
    "JavaScript to listen to a browser event.", 
    "And then you're going to execute a function.", 
    "Pretty simple.", 
    "It just takes them 1,000 pages to tell you.", 
    "But they also teach you about the language at the same time.", 
    "But that's really all we're doing.", 
    "In the back, can you read that?", 
    "Yes?", 
    "Large enough?", 
    "OK.", 
    "So let's say we wanted to put a button on a page and that button would change", 
    "all the user's name everywhere on the page to Armando.", 
    "Right?", 
    "We would write a really simple function.", 
    "I'm going to do this.", 
    "This will totally screw that up.", 
    "Anyway.", 
    "All we're doing here is getting all of the elements out of the document.", 
    "This is the standard DOM API implementation.", 
    "We're just going to go find all the elements with the class name username.", 
    "We're gonna iterate over them.", 
    "And we're going to go to change the innerHTML to Armando on", 
    "every single one.", 
    "And then we're going to go get that button, which happens to have an ID on", 
    "it of name-changer.", 
    "And then we're going to add an event lister to click, right?", 
    "So the next time the user clicks on that, everywhere on the page that the", 
    "user name is being addressed it's personalized to your instructor.", 
    "So what does your doc look like now if you do something like this?", 
    "Well, we take that static block of HTML.", 
    "And maybe we'll throw some JavaScript at the bottom.", 
    "These will be script tags.", 
    "Done in line and much the way that your HTML--", 
    "as it comes down from the server, that you so carefully templated out in your", 
    "Rails app--", 
    "gets received by the browser.", 
    "It's going to do all the flow, all the CSS to make all that page pretty.", 
    "And then it's going to evaluate this JS inside the JS interpreter that sits", 
    "there on the side, right.", 
    "So the way I always picture the browser is, we've got this gorgeous", 
    "node rendering with CSS to do document flow for the visual presentation.", 
    "And we've got this JS interpreter going in the background, right, that's", 
    "listening for events--", 
    "sorry, that you can abut your code into to do things like setting up for", 
    "listening for events.", 
    "So what?", 
    "Like, what does that mean?", 
    "Doesn't-- like, all we've done is change some text on the page.", 
    "It's not that big a deal."
