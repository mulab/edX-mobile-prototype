    "SOLOM HEDDAYA: Let me give you a little bit of a sense of", 
    "the dynamics of scale.", 
    "So this is a comparison between Cosmos in the beginning of the six-month", 
    "period of--", 
    "it says February, but really about the same as it was in January--", 
    "from January to June of this year.", 
    "So one of the interesting things you see is that we jumped in the amount of", 
    "data, primarily by software.", 
    "So we made a big push last year to improve compression.", 
    "We had a big reduction in the amount of work needed to process these jobs.", 
    "I mentioned 37% more efficient.", 
    "Together with utilization, this metric attempts to capture the efficiency of", 
    "the system--", 
    "how much you're getting out of it in terms of benefit relative to cost.", 
    "And then pure latency--", 
    "we use Terasort as a kind of a canary.", 
    "In the coal mine, Terasort is benchmark.", 
    "If you haven't heard of it, it's a simple benchmark to", 
    "sort 100-byte records.", 
    "And you you sort a terabyte of these.", 
    "This is supposed to finish in about a minute, and now it's really more", 
    "appropriately called Minutesort.", 
    "We run it all the time in the cluster in production in a shared environment,", 
    "and we watch what happens to it.", 
    "And that's how we measure some of the improvements in speed.", 
    "We also have a big, actually, development environment.", 
    "In fact, we have an extension to Visual Studio that you can write code", 
    "in for Cosmos.", 
    "No only that, this extension does static code analysis to help you find", 
    "bugs in your code.", 
    "This is consistent with our focus on development.", 
    "You may have seen the old by now video of Steve Ballmer jumping up and down", 
    "screaming developers, developers, developers.", 
    "If you want to find it on YouTube, search for, I think, Ballmer Monkey", 
    "Boy, or something like that.", 
    "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "SOLOM HEDDAYA: So this is a snapshot that gives you a sense of scale.", 
    "So this is actually very recent.", 
    "This is from the last couple of days.", 
    "On one of our own clusters running old machines, we are about to decommission", 
    "this cluster, so we're shrinking it down.", 
    "So just to give you a sense, this cluster has 14,500", 
    "machines that are active.", 
    "And this is actually, by far, the smallest cluster we have today.", 
    "We build clusters that are much bigger than practically anyone else in the", 
    "industry does, and we've been doing that for a long time.", 
    "The reason is we want to have this very high utilization.", 
    "We favor utilization over predictability of performance.", 
    "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]?", 
    "SOLOM HEDDAYA: Because we do statistical multiplexing.", 
    "We want people to share the data without making unnecessary copies.", 
    "We want people to make copies only for [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "Not for consuming the data.", 
    "And so we end up having compute contention and I/O contention.", 
    "So you can see that on this cluster, which is 14,500 machines, we're doing", 
    "81 petabytes per day of I/O. And that gives you a sense of scale.", 
    "Of that, net net, 3 petabytes are being created for permanent storage.", 
    "Because a lot of the I/O is being done for temporary results.", 
    "And one footnote is that the NIC utilization--", 
    "it's not just the process utilization that's high-- the NIC utilization is", 
    "also very high.", 
    "It's 30 to 40%.", 
    "These are old machines, though.", 
    "So these have 1 gigabit per second NIC.", 
    "Still, to have an average over a week over tens of thousands of machines", 
    "where you're doing 300, 400 megabits per second, average, that's very high.", 
    "That stresses everything in the OS.", 
    "It stresses the switches, and in the end, stresses the performance of the", 
    "jobs the customers submit.", 
    "So the key points I wanted to kind of capture from that before I go to", 
    "architecture is that the scale--", 
    "the huge amount of work that we want to put together in a", 
    "single shared space--", 
    "together with the drive for economy.", 
    "These two together create enormous force, an enormous", 
    "pressure on the design.", 
    "So what is a design?", 
    "It's pretty common if you've seen Hadoop before.", 
    "We have, on the store side, it's an immutable append-only store, it's data", 
    "flow computation, except that MapReduce has a series parallel data", 
    "flow or function program.", 
    "We allow a more general directed [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "And there is a declarative programming language, and here's the", 
    "reference to the page.", 
    "So there are two levels of [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "One is that we allow extensibility by allowing arbitrary C# programs inside", 
    "each of these vertices.", 
    "Now, that's really not a full answer, because you can do that with Hadoop,", 
    "with Java, and MapReduce and you put Java or you can put any", 
    "language you want.", 
    "You have that extensibility in a function model as well.", 
    "However, I suspect, but I don't know--", 
    "I suspect that our customers use C# a lot more in Scope than in other", 
    "systems, precisely because of this limitation.", 
    "So that's one.", 
    "The second is that--", 
    "so in that case, essentially, they use Scope to control the [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "computation as opposed to actually do the work.", 
    "But the full answer is really that we have our customers who want to do", 
    "really significant general purpose computation.", 
    "They end up not writing code in Cosmos.", 
    "They write some of their code in Scope, take the output, move it", 
    "outside, run on a, say, machine learning algorithms, iterative", 
    "algorithms, then they bring the result back in.", 
    "And that's very inconvenient for them, and that's actually one of the reasons", 
    "why I have been trying to recruit [INAUDIBLE] or at least get him to", 
    "come to Microsoft.", 
    "STUDENT: [INAUBIDLE].", 
    "SOLOM HEDDAYA: But that's a very important, actually, challenge for us", 
    "for the future, and I mentioned that actually.", 
    "So one of the key organizing principles other than the high-level", 
    "programming language is sharing physical and logical resources for the", 
    "reasons I mentioned.", 
    "And as a result, we have giant clusters, shared by reference only,", 
    "roughly zero copying.", 
    "All computation is affinitized to data.", 
    "This is actually something that's very different also between", 
    "us and many of the--", 
    "which is that what this statement manifests itself as is that we really", 
    "prefer to ship computation to the data rather than the other way around.", 
    "Even though we have been building those non-blocking networks with", 
    "randomized routing and so on inside the data center, so that the network", 
    "inside the data center looks much more like a network for a massive", 
    "[INAUDIBLE] data parallel machine from the '90s than it does looking like the", 
    "data center.", 
    "But it also manifests itself in a physical way,", 
    "like when we buy hardware.", 
    "In the end, you have to buy a piece of machine.", 
    "When we buy hardware, we buy different hardware than most people do.", 
    "We buy hardware that has a small amount of disc, and a small amount of", 
    "processing, and that's it.", 
    "We buy the cheapest possible machine we can get our hands on with big RAM.", 
    "And as a result, we don't have a special storage configuration for our", 
    "server and a compute configuration.", 
    "It's one configuration.", 
    "This, of course, creates problems, but it creates huge opportunities because", 
    "it allows us to buy these machines at a huge scale and not worry about the", 
    "differences between them.", 
    "Because there are differences.", 
    "Everyone uses the same hardware, including Bing search, including ads,", 
    "MSN, everyone uses the same hardware.", 
    "Now, the challenges to come out of our architecture and modeling and so on is", 
    "that our scale is growing, first, really fast in an actual way.", 
    "So our scale is growing, essentially, in terms of every dimension you'd", 
    "bother to measure.", 
    "We scale about 2x per year, so 100% a year, and that's the square of Moore's", 
    "law, so we can't really use hardware to keep up.", 
    "And that's very, very stressful, but beyond that, we need to make big jumps", 
    "on top of this 2x a year.", 
    "By the way, this has been going on for five or six years already.", 
    "So even at our our scale we're still growing at 2x a year.", 
    "But on top of that, we want to grow much bigger,", 
    "and that's very intensive.", 
    "That's why we have people like Ed Nightingale, who's, I think, coming to", 
    "give a talk in a couple weeks or something like that.", 
    "Working on the storage scale.", 
    "In addition, we have massive contention, for", 
    "the reason I mentioned.", 
    "And then we have variety of programming models, like you said,", 
    "that are needed.", 
    "Not just for machine learning, for streaming.", 
    "So Cosmos, it feels very much like you're kneading dough.", 
    "Like you read data, because it's immutable, now we can't update it.", 
    "You write a fresh copy.", 
    "This kind of is a little intense, and too much.", 
    "But in certain ways.", 
    "So we are changing that.", 
    "But if you think about it a little more, you say, when do I do one of", 
    "these iterations?", 
    "What I do is for an interval of time.", 
    "So I have my sensors collecting data and I say, I process an hour of data,", 
    "an hour of clicks, and hour of searches, or a minute, or whatever.",
