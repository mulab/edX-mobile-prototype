    "Armando Fox: Well, let's go through these.", 
    "Usually results in more concise code, fewer total lines.", 
    "Actually, we just did an example where the code, by every measure improved,", 
    "but it got bigger.", 
    "So, conciseness is in the eye of the beholder.", 
    "Minimum total number lines of code in your app is not really a measure of", 
    "conciseness.", 
    "It's whether a given task is being done with clarity in the smallest", 
    "amount of space.", 
    "And in this case, getting to clarity resulted in adding more code.", 
    "Simple as that.", 
    "So that's not true.", 
    "Should not cause existing test to fail.", 
    "Well even in our simple example, at one point we changed the calling API", 
    "when we encapsulated that thing in a class, as soon as you have a class,", 
    "you have to call and initialize it.", 
    "Right?", 
    "We didn't have to do that in the original version of the code.", 
    "So if we had had tests that tested the original version of the code, they", 
    "would have immediately failed for structural reasons alone.", 
    "So in fact, it's not a problem if refactoring temporarily causes", 
    "existing tests to fail but as long as you know why it failed--", 
    "did it fail because you actually broke something?", 
    "Or did it fail because you've changed the structure of the code in a way", 
    "that makes it incompatible with the assumptions of the test?", 
    "The first kind of failure should be an alarm because it means that in", 
    "refactoring your knowledge about what could be refactored was incorrect.", 
    "Something fails for a logical reason.", 
    "But if it's a structural reason, you changed the name of a method, you", 
    "moved something out into a helper and you have to call it differently than", 
    "it used to be called, those are structural reasons that might cause", 
    "tests to fail and you got to fix the tests.", 
    "So that means, by the way, that blue-- in case you weren't following that", 
    "explanation--", 
    "is the correct answer.", 
    "That often you have to change or expand your test suite in order to go", 
    "along with the refactoring that you've done.", 
    "And in terms of explicit versus implicit customer requirements, the", 
    "customer doesn't care if the code's readable, for the most part.", 
    "They care if it works.", 
    "You're the one who suffers if the code's not readable or the poor schmo", 
    "who has to come after you and fix it all up.", 
    "So you could maybe argue that it's an implicit customer requirement, at", 
    "best, but rarely will the customer say, and by the way, your code needs", 
    "to have a Flog score below some number.", 
    "So, with that, we'll temporarily leave off of our refactoring.", 
    "We'll revisit some of these ideas when we talk about design patterns, but for", 
    "now, it's time to talk about teams.", 
    "A topic about which my colleague is much more qualified.", 
    "PROFESSOR 2: I'm only going to get through one or two of these today.", 
    "But the first one is it takes a team and I'm going to talk about Scrum.", 
    "And I think I just wanted to say, what's interesting about this set of", 
    "the lectures--", 
    "is since I've been--", 
    "I'm old enough to be your grandfather here--", 
    "so I've been here a long time and there's a bunch of stuff that you", 
    "learn now that's going to go away.", 
    "I learned stuff that people can't believe that I learned.", 
    "But there are some things that are going to work just as well, you're", 
    "going to learn now, it's going to work your whole career.", 
    "And that's the team stuff here.", 
    "The stuff that the people skills--", 
    "people aren't going to change very much over the next 50 years.", 
    "Now that steroids are banned maybe they're not gonna change that much.", 
    "Getting along with people, how to lead a group of people, how to be", 
    "successful, this is something you're going to want to learn because you're", 
    "going to need it your whole time.", 
    "So, for me personally, personalizing this team stuff, is I was on wrestling", 
    "teams both in high school and college and we won a state championship.", 
    "That's me right there.", 
    "That's why Armando said I could wrestle him to the floor.", 
    "I'm pretty sure that's true.", 
    "So wrestling's an individual sport.", 
    "So, kind of weird, how did I learn to be a team?", 
    "I just happened to be on teams in high school and college that had really", 
    "great coaches.", 
    "And they felt that the way to have a successful wrestling team is not just", 
    "a bunch of individual stars, but to pull together and figure out how you'd", 
    "root for each other and help each other and you'd win collectively, even", 
    "though you're all individuals.", 
    "So somehow, from that I got how to lead teams and form teams and be", 
    "successful.", 
    "So, if you look at my career, everything's team oriented.", 
    "I often co-teach like Armando.", 
    "I've co-authored six books, everyone is co-authored like", 
    "the one with Armando.", 
    "Most of my papers are co-authored.", 
    "The research projects I've done, I've done 10 or 11 five year projects", 
    "overlapping.", 
    "They're all with multiple faculty, so everything I do is with groups of", 
    "people and I find it more effective this way.", 
    "This one is actually--", 
    "this happened last year, this is actually a 50 year reunion.", 
    "This is my good friend who was my best man at my wedding and I was at his.", 
    "That's him and I almost 50 years apart and that's our wrestling coach when we", 
    "got together.", 
    "So pay attention to this.", 
    "This stuff is going to matter your whole career.", 
    "Oh, you know, some of the programming language stuff is going to come and go", 
    "but not team oriented things.", 
    "So, the interesting thing is now a software engineering is a team sport.", 
    "It used to be an individual sport.", 
    "It used to be like the individual wrestlers.", 
    "And there are people I know who were at the state of the outer software at", 
    "that time, that the hero programmer, the individual was the one who thinks", 
    "like Ken Thompson.", 
    "Ken Thompson, the co-inventor of Unix, he was a Berkeley student.", 
    "Bill Joy.", 
    "He's the guy I mentioned.", 
    "He was one of the founders of Berkeley software Unix.", 
    "Kind of the first open source project.", 
    "He was a brilliant image programmers.", 
    "He came up with VI over the weekend, the visuals editor.", 
    "John Osterhoudt who I mentioned.", 
    "When he was a young faculty member here, he wrote a computer aided design", 
    "tool all by itself that was better than anything that was out there.", 
    "So, we are now in the post-superhero programmer era.", 
    "You don't hear of individuals doing it anymore.", 
    "So I think what's happened is basically it's the bar of", 
    "functionality and quality is too high for one person to do it all by", 
    "themselves.", 
    "So that era is behind you.", 
    "You don't hear people doing it alone.", 
    "You hear Linus Torvalds with Linux.", 
    "But it wasn't just him doing that.", 
    "He's leading a very large group of people in the open source thing so you", 
    "don't hear that anymore.", 
    "So you have to figure out how to work in groups.", 
    "To have a successful career, you're going to not only have great", 
    "programming chops, but you have to work well with others and", 
    "help make a team win.", 
    "So, what is help making a team win?", 
    "This is Fred Brooks, one of our heroes in computing.", 
    "He's quoting his basketball coach at University at North Carolina.", 
    "So, there are no winners on a losing team and no losers on a winning team.", 
    "You have to do what it takes to make your team win.", 
    "You can't be, well, I was fine, but the other guys suck and so I did OK.", 
    "That's not how teams work.", 
    "The teams collectively work together and you have to figure that out.", 
    "And this is a thing that the feedback we get from industry that people care", 
    "a lot about teams.", 
    "Do you learn how to work with teams?", 
    "Now, the good news, and one of the things that are Armando and I are", 
    "excited about teaching the course this way, is that software has been", 
    "reinvented in a way that makes it easier to match to the class.", 
    "So Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, came up with this term, the \"two pizza", 
    "team.\" And Armando's talked about just because the calories per year go up", 
    "for Americans doesn't mean the teams are getting smaller.", 
    "It meant like say four to nine people would get together and that's an", 
    "effective size.", 
    "Now, how do you organize that team?", 
    "There's been a terminology came up a few years ago called Scrum, which", 
    "comes from rugby and the idea is every day at the same time the two pizza", 
    "team gets together and you go around the circle and you ask each other", 
    "questions to see where you are.", 
    "If you want to learn more about that, that book does it.", 
    "But these ideas are pretty-- that's the other thing about team stuff, it's", 
    "pretty straightforward.", 
    "You answer these three questions.", 
    "What have you done since yesterday?", 
    "What are you planning to do today, and are there any impediments.", 
    "And the idea is, as you go around in a group, you can figure out, well, if", 
    "you just did that in different orders, I wouldn't be blocked.", 
    "And you can talk that over.", 
    "And it's a short stand up meeting to do that.", 
    "So that's a big part of the Scrum ideas.", 
    "And we direct you to be able to do that.", 
    "The other question is, what are the roles?", 
    "There's the team, that's one role.", 
    "Then there's something called the Scrum Master.", 
    "That's somebody who is the team member who acts as the buffer between the", 
    "team and all external people.", 
    "People want to have meetings with you, the Scrum Master handles that.", 
    "Make sure the teams working on the stories you're supposed to be working", 
    "on, if you have rules about how you're supposed to do things, the Scrum", 
    "Master enforces.", 
    "And anything that's in the way.", 
    "The computers are too slow.", 
    "OK.", 
    "That's my job to be able to take care of it.", 
    "The final role is what's called the product owner and that's the person", 
    "who acts as the advocate for the customer.", 
    "And that's the person who prioritized the user storage.", 
    "You're pretending to be the customer on that.", 
    "So, basically Scrum is a self organizing small team, daily meetings,", 
    "they work what's called sprints, like in like an rugby as opposed to the", 
    "iterations of Agile.", 
    "So maybe two weeks or four weeks everybody's already go and works hard", 
    "for two to four weeks and then they stop and see where they are.", 
    "And the members rotate through that role.", 
    "In Scrum, I played rugby, when there's a violation you get together, the mass", 
    "of people push at each other and that's where the idea is", 
    "supposed to come from.", 
    "So with that, questions about what's true about Scrum?", 
    "We'll do a quick question.", 
    "Scrum is at its best when it's difficult to plan ahead.", 
    "Scrum is as good for safety critical software as well", 
    "as software to service.", 
    "Scrum implies Agile development.", 
    "All of them are true.", 
    "So let's do a quick vote.", 
    "One, two, three, vote.", 
    "All right.", 
    "I see oranges and blues here.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Let me just go over it.", 
    "The Scrum doesn't actually--", 
    "it's not all true because you don't have to use Agile", 
    "development with Scrum.", 
    "It's a good match but some people do use Scrum for other models.", 
    "Just getting together every day and talking about what's", 
    "your problems is useful.", 
    "Scrum is as good for safety critical software.", 
    "Armando and I think that, boy, if planes are going to fall out of the", 
    "sky, maybe you need a more careful standards and more careful riding.", 
    "People argue with me that you could use Scrum for safety", 
    "critical software as well.", 
    "There's advantages but it's really at its strength when you can plan ahead.", 
    "OK with that, we will come back on Wednesday and learn more about teams."
