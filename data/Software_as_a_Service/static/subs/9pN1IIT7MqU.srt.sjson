    "ARMANDO FOX: The reason that there isn't enough information to determine", 
    "the answer is because there's another piece of the contract that hasn't been", 
    "specified, which is 99.9% over what time scale?", 
    "Or over what number of requests?", 
    "So this is something that I alluded to when we started talking about", 
    "availability, which is if you don't specify the availability window, you", 
    "could always cheat and say, well, if you just wait--", 
    "instead of measuring over a week, measure it over a year.", 
    "Then I bet we'll get it right.", 
    "So the critical piece of information that's missing is 99.9% target uptime", 
    "over what time period?", 
    "Or, if you wanted to do it in terms of number of requests, you'd have to say", 
    "99.9% measured over any batch of how many requests.", 
    "But we didn't do either one.", 
    "So technically in this situation, you actually can't tell.", 
    "So if we had said that it was 99.9% over a year, Five 9's is", 
    "5 minutes per year.", 
    "So let's see.", 
    "Three 9's would be 500 minutes a year.", 
    "Three 9's is 500 minutes a year.", 
    "And we had a 1 hour outage yesterday, which is only 60 minutes.", 
    "So if we had said it's over the scale of a year, then sure.", 
    "We've got plenty of other chances.", 
    "Over the scale of a year, assuming we haven't had outages earlier this year,", 
    "we're probably still on track.", 
    "So I think the message should be pretty clear though.", 
    "Any time you're talking about--", 
    "whether it's Apdex or whether it's a classic SLO contract, you need to", 
    "specify something about the time window or the number of requests", 
    "window over which you're going to measure it.", 
    "Otherwise there's really no way to tell.", 
    "So the next thing to talk about is continuous deployment and continuous", 
    "integration.", 
    "And this represents, to my mind, one of the biggest changes in the", 
    "operational side of how Agile and cloud have changed things.", 
    "We've already seen that the Agile development process is very much a", 
    "refactoring and a rethinking of the same kinds of steps that had always", 
    "been done in other models like Waterfall, but they've now been", 
    "factored differently.", 
    "So instead of doing only requirements analysis once at the beginning, you're", 
    "sort of doing it at every iteration as you develop new features.", 
    "Instead of refactoring when you have to adjust your legacy code to", 
    "accommodate some new feature, you're always refactoring.", 
    "You're looking for opportunities to make your code better so that no", 
    "single refactoring task becomes a big dominant activity.", 
    "So the theme of this part of the discussion is those same ideas can be", 
    "applied to how you do your integration testing right before deployment and", 
    "how you manage your deployment and your releases.", 
    "For many of you, 1995 probably qualifies as computer history.", 
    "Not for me.", 
    "But this is one of an immense number of pictures from one of the many", 
    "launch parties of Windows 95.", 
    "This is back when launches were a real event.", 
    "And I think at the time that this happened it was probably the most", 
    "extravagant computer-related product launch ever.", 
    "This is before Steve Jobs became the people that you camp out to see before", 
    "WWDC and stuff like that.", 
    "But back in the day, if my memory serves, among other things for the", 
    "Windows 95 launch party they licensed the song \"Start Me Up\" from The", 
    "Rolling Stones to commemorate the appearance of the new Start menu.", 
    "That's the menu that you go to when you want to stop using your computer,", 
    "is the Start menu.", 
    "Don't forget.", 
    "And they also paid to have the Empire State Building in New York lit up in", 
    "the colors of the Windows logo.", 
    "So I don't know how that improves product quality.", 
    "But this was a really big event.", 
    "Releases used to be a huge deal.", 
    "You're working on a product for like years, and then the big day is here", 
    "when everybody has to upgrade.", 
    "Things are somewhat different now, especially in Software as a Service.", 
    "I have gathered a few examples from companies you may have heard of.", 
    "As of late 2011, at Facebook the master branch gets", 
    "pushed about weekly.", 
    "They're aiming to push once a day.", 
    "So actually since this conversation I had with their director of engineering", 
    "that may have been achieved.", 
    "And this is releasing to production.", 
    "Releasing to the--", 
    "I don't know how many hundreds of millions of users Facebook now has.", 
    "So this is really releasing in the sense that new functionality is being", 
    "made available to all the customers.", 
    "So they're aiming to release once a day.", 
    "Amazon releases several times a week.", 
    "Now of course Amazon's site as a whole is enormously complicated.", 
    "But some part of that site is getting new functionality that is being", 
    "experienced by customers several times a week.", 
    "At Stack Overflow they deploy multiple times a day.", 
    "So a new functionality is being pushed out multiple times a day.", 
    "And if you think about it, the rationale is actually very sound.", 
    "And this formulation, I give credit to the guys at Pivotal Labs.", 
    "Basically, the number of hours between deployments represents the level of", 
    "risk that you're taking in your new deploy.", 
    "Part of the risk is whether the stuff that worked the way you thought in", 
    "staging and in development will also work just as well in production.", 
    "The smaller the incremental change, the less you have to recover from if a", 
    "disaster happens when you push the button.", 
    "But it also has to do with the risk associated with the customer not", 
    "liking what you did.", 
    "Maybe when you had your meeting with the customer they didn't", 
    "see what you saw.", 
    "Maybe you implemented what you believed they said they wanted, but", 
    "they change their mind or the design you actually executed to is not what", 
    "they wanted.", 
    "So in that case, if it's only been a week since your last deployment you've", 
    "only risked sort of one week's worth of engineer hours.", 
    "That's the amount of work that has to be thrown out or that you have", 
    "to undo part of.", 
    "So it makes a lot of sense when you look at it from that perspective.", 
    "And the next logical step is to say, well, if you're going to deploy", 
    "multiple times a week or multiple times a day, then deployment should", 
    "not be a big party and everybody biting their fingernails.", 
    "It should be a non-event.", 
    "It should be something that you can sort of realistically do all the time.", 
    "So that's what continuous deployment really refers to.", 
    "As we've already seen, the key to being able to make something a", 
    "non-event is to get to the point where you can automate it.", 
    "It's such a well-defined procedure that you can write down that you can", 
    "rely on tools to help you do it more consistently.", 
    "So we've already seen that sites like Heroku already do this.", 
    "Heroku behaves like a Git repository essentially, that when you push to it", 
    "it has the side effect of running all these jobs on the back end that load", 
    "up your gems and deploy your app for you.", 
    "If you're not using sites like Heroku, there's tools like Capistrano.", 
    "If you're deploying your own app on something like a", 
    "virtual private server.", 
    "That, again, support both standardized flows for generic deployment tasks and", 
    "also things that you can customize yourself.", 
    "And related to this is continuous integration, which is essentially", 
    "integration testing of the application beyond what the developers are doing", 
    "on their own desktop.", 
    "And a typical sequence for is that when you're coming up on a release--", 
    "whether it's multiple times a day or whatever--", 
    "the code check in for that release candidate will trigger a run of", 
    "continuous integration tests.", 
    "And because you're doing releases all the time, the CI infrastructure might", 
    "probably always be running.", 
    "In fact, there's now companies like Sauce Labs that provide continuous", 
    "integration as a service.", 
    "And a common strategy like we've seen with other services, is GitHub has", 
    "deployment hooks that allow you to automate this.", 
    "So whenever a push happens on a certain branch, for example, GitHub", 
    "can use a post-deployment hook to trigger a continuous integration run", 
    "on whatever your CI platform.", 
    "So I'm not going to show the hooks example here", 
    "because there isn't really--", 
    "if you've look at the GitHub service hooks any one of the services, there's", 
    "hooks to integrate with Travis, which is a Ruby-based CI environment.", 
    "There's hooks to integrate with commercial CI environments.", 
    "So again, the idea is, how much of this process can you mechanize?", 
    "How much of it can you make easily reproducible through", 
    "a mechanical process?", 
    "So why would you do this at all?", 
    "Why do people do CI in the real world?", 
    "Probably one of the biggest ones is, as we've seen, there's always a risk", 
    "of differences between your development stage and your production", 
    "environments that are difficult to find when you're doing your own", 
    "developer-level testing.", 
    "You might also want to test across different browsers or across different", 
    "versions of the same browser.", 
    "Again, there's an extent to which you could probably do", 
    "some of that yourself.", 
    "But there's also now emerging commercial services like Sauce Labs", 
    "where you basically say, here's a matrix of operating systems and", 
    "browser versions.", 
    "And you just check which boxes you want to test it as.", 
    "And you can get either Cucumber Scenarios to run with a", 
    "Selenium back end.", 
    "Or you can get, essentially, little videos where you can watch the ghost", 
    "user testing all the scenarios of your app.", 
    "And you can manually see if something goes wrong, exactly", 
    "where it went wrong.", 
    "Some of you are working on projects that rely on integration", 
    "with a remote service.", 
    "You're exercising the principles of service-oriented architecture.", 
    "In some cases, the--", 
    "of course, you've already got some tests in place to simulate how your", 
    "app responds when the remote service that you're relying", 
    "on starts to misbehave.", 
    "If it reacts too slowly or it returns garbage or gives you an", 
    "exception or whatever.", 
    "But of course, there's always a possibility of it might misbehave in", 
    "ways you didn't think of.", 
    "And testing that in integration, that gives you a wider variety of scenarios", 
    "that you can potentially test.", 
    "Protection against attacks.", 
    "One of the things you can do when you're in a continuous integration", 
    "environment is run a variety of different kinds of attacks and test", 
    "the code paths that are supposed to protect you against them.", 
    "Stress testing and longevity testing.", 
    "There are certain kinds of bugs that really only show up after you use the", 
    "app for a long time.", 
    "They may be resource leaks, memory leaks, things like that.", 
    "They may be code paths that are just exercised very, very infrequently.", 
    "So again, a lot of these things will go beyond the kind of testing that's", 
    "practical for you to be doing all the time as a developer, but it's", 
    "perfectly reasonable to have a staging or CI environment where you're doing", 
    "these extra tests.", 
    "As one data point, Salesforce, which a lot of people think of as the", 
    "originator of the idea of software as a service, has an integration system", 
    "where they run over 150,000 tests whenever they're about", 
    "to push a new version.", 
    "And it automatically files bug reports whenever any of those", 
    "integration test fails.", 
    "It can actually walk the code tree and figure out which subunit or which", 
    "module caused the CI regression to fail.", 
    "And the developer automatically gets any bug reports.", 
    "So that's what I would call a really good degree of automation.", 
    "Every time you're ready to release, there's actually an entire mechanical", 
    "process that does an additional level of quality checking beyond what you've", 
    "already done in your development environment.", 
    "So a continuous deployment is a pretty simple extension of this.", 
    "If you've already got a CI flow, then the next step is assuming your CI,", 
    "your continuous integration test, all pass, then the next step is your CI", 
    "automatically says, OK to deploy.", 
    "And it manages the deployment for you.", 
    "So in many cases, your view as a developer of the button to push for", 
    "deployment, you're actually pushing a button to run the continuous", 
    "integration tests.", 
    "And conditioned on the passing of those tests, there's another button", 
    "that gets pushed automatically to actually do the deploy.", 
    "So the question arises, if you're really releasing several times a day", 
    "does it make sense to even talk about the concept of releases at all?", 
    "And in fact, it does.", 
    "But now the releases really become more of a customer-facing milestone.", 
    "So for example, the customer may have requested a specific new feature.", 
    "And to get that feature in has required a number", 
    "of different changes.", 
    "It's required multiple stories to be written and tested.", 
    "It's required changes to a number of different subsystems of the app.", 
    "Maybe it's required some database migrations.", 
    "So you're not going to necessarily deploy all of that", 
    "stuff in one big chunk.", 
    "In fact, you'd be advised not to do that.", 
    "You've probably had a bunch of intermediate deployments to make sure", 
    "that you haven't broken anything.", 
    "So as you're building towards completion of the user's feature, you", 
    "have more and more functionality in place but not all of it.", 
    "And therefore, there's something in your user interface that makes sure", 
    "that the feature isn't actually visible for the user to interact with.", 
    "And then, on release day, then you flip the switch that says, now the", 
    "feature becomes available to the user and they can actually", 
    "play around with it.", 
    "So customers still understand the concept of a milestone as progress has", 
    "been made in the form of a new feature I asked for is now 100% implemented.", 
    "One way that you can manage this is you can tag specific commits with", 
    "whimsical names.", 
    "So Heroku does this for their deployment stacks.", 
    "They give them names Celadon Cedar and Something Bamboo.", 
    "Because Git does everything, it gives you a way to give symbolic tag names", 
    "to a particular revision of the entire tree on some certain branch and to", 
    "push those tags to the repo as well.", 
    "So for example, if you're going to do what you think of as a major release,", 
    "you give the release a tag.", 
    "And then you can also use that tag to identify any customer reported bugs", 
    "once the release has succeeded.", 
    "Or you could just do what we've always been doing and use those long commit", 
    "IDs to identify the release.", 
    "But either way, the idea of these points in time that are widely", 
    "separated, just like with the Agile life cycle where you don't want to go", 
    "a long time without merging all the feature branches of the code back into", 
    "the master branch.", 
    "You don't want to go a long time between the writing of code and the", 
    "creation of tests that go with that code.", 
    "Everything is sort of very tightly coupled so that you always have", 
    "working code.", 
    "It's almost like when you're about to start making any kind of changes, you", 
    "acknowledge that you're about to break something.", 
    "And as soon as you start breaking it, you're immediate goal is how soon can", 
    "you get it back to something that's stable and working.", 
    "So if you just take that same mindset and apply it to integration", 
    "deployment, then you get this.", 
    "So with that in mind, suppose we just got some new Ajax features into", 
    "RottenPotatoes.", 
    "Much tastier ones than the ones that I showed in the JavaScript section.", 
    "Where would it makes sense to test those features?", 
    "You could use autotest with RSpec and Cucumber.", 
    "You could test them in a continuous integration environment.", 
    "You could test them in staging.", 
    "Or are all of those places appropriate for testing?"
