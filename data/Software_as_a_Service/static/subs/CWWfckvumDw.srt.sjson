    "DAVID PATTERSON: I'm sorry I can't be there, but I'm delighted to get a", 
    "chance to tell you about your Cal cultural heritage now that you've", 
    "taken this course, and what I hope you'll remember about it.", 
    "So what should we emphasize about the University of California at Berkeley,", 
    "also known as Cal?", 
    "It's the top public university according to this magazine.", 
    "Almost all of our graduate programs are in the top 10, 99%.", 
    "It's the university doing the most public good", 
    "according to this magazine.", 
    "And the faculty have garnered a ton of awards--", 
    "nine Nobel Prize winners, another six in fields that you can't win Nobel", 
    "Prizes in, including computer science and math.", 
    "Four Pulitzer Prize winners, 32 \"Genius\" awards, and more than 90 in", 
    "the National Academy of Engineering, and more than 140 in the National", 
    "Academy of Sciences which no other university can match.", 
    "That's Cal overall.", 
    "What about computer science?", 
    "Well the US News and World Report for decades has been ranking the top", 
    "computer science departments.", 
    "And for many years, it's been a four-way tie between Berkeley,", 
    "Carnegie Mellon, MIT, and Stanford.", 
    "They also rate four specialties.", 
    "And Armando and I are in computer systems where you design and build", 
    "hardware and software.", 
    "And software engineering's certainly part of computer systems.", 
    "Well the ranking's been unquestionable.", 
    "Berkeley's been number one in computer systems for decades and a", 
    "clear number one.", 
    "So that's the campus perspective.", 
    "But perception can lag reality, especially in academia.", 
    "So any recent evidence that we're number one?", 
    "In 2007, Intel and Microsoft announced they would fund a Universal Parallel", 
    "Research Center--", 
    "$2 million a year for five years.", 
    "They opened it up to the top 25 computer science departments and", 
    "picked four that they would do site visits and ask more detailed questions", 
    "including Berkeley, Illinois, MIT, and Stanford's--", 
    "three of the top four.", 
    "And five years ago, they announced that Berkeley is unanimously picked by", 
    "the technical committee as the top choice to get that center.", 
    "What about more recently?", 
    "In 2011, in computer science theory, the Simons Foundation announced they", 
    "would do a center-- this time $6 million a year for 10 years.", 
    "They invited lots of computer science departments to compete.", 
    "And the final list that got site visits were Berkeley--", 
    "the only public university--", 
    "the University of Chicago, which is a very wealthy university, and the", 
    "combined two of the most famous and wealthiest universities in the world--", 
    "Harvard and MIT.", 
    "Formidable competition.", 
    "Well in May, Simons Foundation announced that Berkeley was the winner", 
    "and would have the Simons Foundation.", 
    "So in my career, there have been two open competitions.", 
    "And amazingly, one university won both of those.", 
    "And that university is Cal.", 
    "So what's your heritage?", 
    "Is it this intellectual thing?", 
    "No.", 
    "We're going to talk about your athletic heritage, which is football.", 
    "So let me explain what football is.", 
    "First of all, we call it soccer, what the rest of world calls football.", 
    "They call football American football.", 
    "Well soccer has 11 on a team.", 
    "There's two teams, one ball, a grass field, move the ball into the goal,", 
    "most goals wins, can't use your hands.", 
    "Well we started with a game like that.", 
    "And we still have 11 on a team and two teams and one ball on a grass field.", 
    "But we're the New World and we wanted to change it from", 
    "our European heritage.", 
    "Because one thing is to increase the scoring, which soccer", 
    "could certainly use.", 
    "Number one, we made the goal a lot bigger, so to fool with the field.", 
    "Number two, your hands are more coordinated than your feet.", 
    "So you can carry the ball with your hands.", 
    "Now since you can carry the ball with your hands, you can toss it to another", 
    "player at any time either laterally or backwards.", 
    "And it's called a lateral.", 
    "And occasionally, you can toss the ball forward which is called a pass.", 
    "So how do you stop a player carrying the ball?", 
    "You grab them and knock them down.", 
    "This is the New World.", 
    "We're big, tough people.", 
    "We tackle them.", 
    "Since in soccer you tackle the ball--", 
    "if you were to tackle the player, it's a penalty.", 
    "In American football, if you tackle the player, people applaud.", 
    "How do you score?", 
    "You move the ball across that goal line and into what's called the end", 
    "zone, scoring what's called a touchdown.", 
    "And you get six points for that.", 
    "That's another way we improve scoring.", 
    "We make the scoring worth more points.", 
    "And you can also score by kicking the football between two poles what are", 
    "called goalposts--", 
    "what's called a field goal.", 
    "Those are worth three points, unless it's after a touchdown.", 
    "Then you get one point, an extra point.", 
    "So we got lots of ways to score in American football.", 
    "And after you score, you give the ball to the other team", 
    "like you do in soccer.", 
    "But we kick at the other team and they actually run a play", 
    "where you can do laterals.", 
    "The game ends when no time is left.", 
    "There's four 15-minute quarters in American football.", 
    "And the person with the ball is stopped.", 
    "In soccer it's two 45-minute halves, but it's up to the referee.", 
    "When the referee looks the watch, it stops immediately.", 
    "Not in soccer.", 
    "You have until that person's tackled, you keep playing.", 
    "You could theoretically play for minutes after the end of the game.", 
    "The fields are similar in size.", 
    "The American football field's a little smaller, a little-- maybe not quite as", 
    "long and narrower.", 
    "But it's a hundred yards, which is about 90 meters from goal", 
    "line to goal line.", 
    "And the end zones are 10 yards or about 90 meters where you can touch it", 
    "down anywhere in there.", 
    "But there's even more of a spectacle to American football", 
    "than there is to soccer.", 
    "The similarity is that we have an arch-rival like derbies in the city of", 
    "Manchester.", 
    "There's Manchester City versus Manchester United, so nearby rivals.", 
    "Our stereotype of Stanford is the rich, elitist snobs.", 
    "We play them in the last game of the season traditionally.", 
    "It's called The Big Game.", 
    "Everybody here knows what that is.", 
    "The winner gets a trophy called The Axe.", 
    "And it's the oldest college football rivalry in the west.", 
    "And we've played 115 of them now.", 
    "We have colors.", 
    "Our colors are blue and gold.", 
    "And you'll see blue and gold on our uniforms.", 
    "Stanford's are red and white.", 
    "And you'll see that at Stanford.", 
    "We have nicknames.", 
    "We're the Golden Bears.", 
    "The state of California on the flag has a bear on it, so", 
    "we're the Golden Bears.", 
    "Stanford's nickname is the Cardinal, which is a color.", 
    "We have a mascot, Oski the Bear, not surprisingly.", 
    "Their mascot is a tree.", 
    "And we have people whose job is to get people in the stands to cheer, and", 
    "they are called cheerleaders.", 
    "But more than that, we have music.", 
    "We have bands.", 
    "These are orchestras that march from both schools at the games typically", 
    "before the game, at halftime between the two halves, and after the game.", 
    "The Stanford game isn't a traditional one.", 
    "It's more like a drinking club.", 
    "If you've seen the movie Animal House, you got a good idea what that's like.", 
    "It plays just one song almost as long as the movie Animal", 
    "House in the 1970s.", 
    "And they cannot march and play, unfortunately.", 
    "They're not capable of doing that.", 
    "They have to run and stand.", 
    "The Cal band is a traditional band that marches in place.", 
    "Let's go back 30 years to one of the Big Games and the way it ended.", 
    "Now why am I excited about this?", 
    "It's my favorite event in sports history, and I'm big into sports.", 
    "Well here's some evidence that it's important.", 
    "Sports Illustrated, the leading sports magazine, says it's one of the top 20", 
    "plays ever.", 
    "A sports show said it was the greatest football play of all", 
    "time, college or pro.", 
    "The AP, Associated Press, said it's the most dramatic ending", 
    "of a football game.", 
    "Even Stanford Magazine now considers it the most famous play.", 
    "And it has its own Wikipedia entry kind of like Israel versus the", 
    "Palestinians, there's Cal and Stanford alumni editing this.", 
    "But over the years, they've reached agreement on what happened.", 
    "So what's the setup for this?", 
    "Stanford has one of the greatest quarterbacks of all", 
    "time in college football.", 
    "To be good at football, you have to have a great college quarterback.", 
    "It's the person who passes that ball forward.", 
    "He went in the college hall of fame and the pro football hall of fame and", 
    "won some Super Bowls, retired a while ago.", 
    "Now Stanford had just taken the lead with four seconds left.", 
    "And so the Cal team captain got all the Cal football players right before", 
    "they get the ball the last time with four seconds left, very little chance,", 
    "and said whatever you do, don't fall with the ball.", 
    "So try to lateral the ball so we can try and score, although the", 
    "odds are very low.", 
    "So let's see what happens in the video.", 
    "[VIDEO PLAYBACK]", 
    "-Harmon will probably try to squib it, and he does.", 
    "Ball comes loose, and the Bears have to get out of bounds.", 
    "Rogers along the sideline, another one.", 
    "They're still in deep trouble at midfield.", 
    "They tried to do a couple of-- the ball is still loose as", 
    "they get it to Rodgers.", 
    "They get it back now to the 30.", 
    "They're down to the 20.", 
    "Oh, the band is out on the field!", 
    "He's going to go into the end zone!", 
    "He's gone into the end zone!", 
    "The Bears!", 
    "The Bears have won!", 
    "The Bears have won!", 
    "Oh my god!", 
    "The most amazing, sensational, dramatic, heart-rending, exciting,", 
    "thrilling finish in the history of college football!", 
    "[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]", 
    "--of the Cal football player--", 
    "Kevin Moen, slamming into the trombone player, Gary Tyrrell here.", 
    "And this text is the radio announcer who called it at the time.", 
    "It's considered surely the most dramatic radio announcing in the", 
    "history of college football.", 
    "So let's go over some of the details about The Play.", 
    "Cal is supposed to have 11 men.", 
    "But this small guy enters the field at the last second to get them up to 11.", 
    "And he makes the first key block to prevent our guy from being tackled.", 
    "Who was Kevin Moen?", 
    "He was not an offensive player.", 
    "He played defense.", 
    "But he got the ball first and latted it to Rodgers, who was the team", 
    "captain who said that.", 
    "He gets the ball.", 
    "And he laterals it to Garner.", 
    "Garner is a smaller guy, again, for a football player, he is a running back.", 
    "He's almost tackled.", 
    "He has two legs and one arm pinned by Stanford players.", 
    "And with one arm, he laterals the ball out.", 
    "Richard Rodgers again gets the ball, and he's yelling give him the", 
    "ball and gets it.", 
    "And he laterals to Dwight Ford.", 
    "Dwight Ford is the smallest player on the field.", 
    "He was wearing tights because he was cold.", 
    "But he's dehydrated.", 
    "So he's getting leg cramps.", 
    "And he can see heading down the field, the three large Stanford football", 
    "players coming up to tackle him.", 
    "So he throws the ball over his shoulder without looking to Kevin Moen", 
    "again and simultaneously blocks three Stanford players.", 
    "The smallest person on the field does that.", 
    "Moen again cuts through the Stanford band who was on the field into the end", 
    "zone and smashes the trombonist, Gary Tyrrell.", 
    "So on the field for Stanford are 22 football players, three Axe Committee", 
    "members, three cheerleaders, and the 144 members of the Stanford band.", 
    "So 172 for Stanford versus Cal.", 
    "Those aren't bad odds.", 
    "And a Cal fan said at the time the \"weakest part of the Stanford defense", 
    "was the woodwinds.\"", 
    "What happened after The Play?", 
    "There are t-shirts from Cal commemorating the play on the football", 
    "with musical notes on it.", 
    "There are notebooks that have that on it, neckties, all", 
    "commemorating The Play.", 
    "It was a big seller.", 
    "A Monday after it, Stanford, to their credit, made 7,000 copies of a fake", 
    "Daily Cal newspaper and spread it around Berkeley saying that the", 
    "National Collegiate Athletic Association reversed the decision.", 
    "But it was a fraud, of course.", 
    "But the Cal players were famous.", 
    "They showed up on TV.", 
    "And they invited the Stanford trombonist who was clobbered to that", 
    "and they became good friends.", 
    "Kevin Moen, the guy who got it first and scored for Cal and the guy he ran", 
    "into are still friends today.", 
    "Now Stanford revised the history.", 
    "They feel like several things are wrong with The Play, that they were", 
    "bad officiating.", 
    "And so they'll change the score back on the trophy to say that", 
    "they won the game.", 
    "That's what they do traditionally.", 
    "Well one of those things, they said the guy had legs pinned and one arm", 
    "pinned and got the ball.", 
    "He was tackled.", 
    "He should have been stopped.", 
    "So thanks to the miracle of computer technology, we've had a fair and", 
    "unbiased evaluation that was done by Dan Garcia and we'll see that in the", 
    "next segment, were there anything wrong with The Play", 
    "using computer animation.", 
    "And let's watch the video again.", 
    "[VIDEO PLAYBACK]", 
    "-But Stanford would never accept their defeat, claiming that Garner was down", 
    "on the Cal 49.", 
    "Thanks to advancements in 3D technology, we can resolve this", 
    "dispute once and for all.", 
    "-Harmon will probably try to squib it, and he does.", 
    "Ball comes loose and the Bears have to get out of bounds.", 
    "Rodgers along the sideline, another one.", 
    "They're still in deep trouble at midfield.", 
    "They tried to do a couple of--", 
    "the ball is still loose as they get it to Rodgers.", 
    "They get it back now to the 30!", 
    "Oh, the band is out on the field!", 
    "He's going to go into the end zone!", 
    "The Bears!", 
    "The Bears have won!", 
    "The Bears have won!", 
    "[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]", 
    "What we've learned in this class is that the era of the superhero", 
    "programmer is over, that software engineering is now a team sport.", 
    "We heard our guest lecturers from a start-up company, a small-ish company,", 
    "and a really large company all say that they're using agile methods and", 
    "they're doing everything with teams and all of them are using Scrum and", 
    "many are using [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "So now it's your social skills as well.", 
    "So you need to have to be successful as a team.", 
    "Fred Brooks, Turing Award winner, one of our heroes, the person who has", 
    "written probably the most influential book in software engineering", 
    "[INAUDIBLE]", 
    "has said, \"There are no winners on a losing team, and no losers on a", 
    "winning team.\" So we hope in this class that you've learned how to work", 
    "as a team and to win.", 
    "And your heritage, going back to American football, is you don't give", 
    "up even when the odds are long.", 
    "Four seconds left, it looks like no chance, you don't give up.", 
    "You don't fall with the ball.", 
    "You could be the smallest person on the field, three big guys are running", 
    "at you, and what you do?", 
    "You make the play and make it.", 
    "And that's your heritage.", 
    "So congratulations.", 
    "Hope you enjoyed the class.", 
    "And don't forget--", 
    "don't fall with the ball."
