    "DAVID PATTERSON: All right, we're continuing our teams play during the", 
    "exciting, for those of you who like sports, exciting baseball playoffs for", 
    "the Bay Area.", 
    "I am wearing what I wore last night to the A's game, and was one of the most", 
    "interesting and best played games of baseball in a long time, with some", 
    "spectacular plays, which makes Armando excited.", 
    "But we're talking about teams, so there's a theme here.", 
    "So last time, we talked about, if you remember, my claim is, who knows", 
    "about, in your career, people are going to talk about Ruby, oh my god,", 
    "that old fashioned language, I can't believe you learned it.", 
    "But the thing about working with people is going to", 
    "last your whole career.", 
    "How to get people to work together, how to make a successful team.", 
    "And the stuff that we're talking about in the next few", 
    "lectures are very practical.", 
    "It's common sense stuff, how to get a group of people together.", 
    "And you can use the tools we're going to tell you about in all kinds of", 
    "situations.", 
    "In fact, we use them for lots of projects that we do around here.", 
    "So let's talk about points.", 
    "So where are we in our agile iteration.", 
    "The talk to the customer that we are starting to do now that we talked", 
    "about last two times, BED and TDD.", 
    "Now we're into this measure velocity piece of it, how to measure progress", 
    "of your team.", 
    "So what we could've done is, start off with doing an average number of", 
    "stories per week.", 
    "But the problem, obviously, common sense, is that some stories are harder", 
    "than other stories.", 
    "You already know that.", 
    "So what we advise you to do is just pick a three point scale, of these", 
    "mythical points, and your team assigns points to the each story--", 
    "one for straightforward, two for medium, and three for very", 
    "complicated.", 
    "And that's where we would recommend you start.", 
    "And then you calculate velocity by calculating how many points, according", 
    "to your assessment, you do per week.", 
    "And what the idea is, it's not that you just signed the points, but you", 
    "write them down.", 
    "You write down the points you signed up for a story, and you see, over", 
    "time, how long it takes.", 
    "So one of the biggest problems with software is estimating how long", 
    "software takes.", 
    "Here is a trivial, common sense approach to actually calculate how", 
    "fast the group of people get these works done based on your ability to", 
    "judge that.", 
    "So you not only get better at judging things, because you're going to write", 
    "down and see how well you do and gee, how hard is this, and then you're", 
    "going to be able to calculate how long it's going to take you to do things.", 
    "So how do you do this?", 
    "What's the high tech approach do this?", 
    "You learned this in kindergarten, right?", 
    "Rock, paper, scissors.", 
    "So what they do at Pivotal Labs, which, I think we'll have a guest", 
    "speaker from Pivotal Labs, probably.", 
    "But it's a very influential, interesting software company.", 
    "They use a Fibonacci scale which, as you remember, maybe not from", 
    "kindergarten, but the next one is the sum of the previous two.", 
    "And so they have one, two, three.", 
    "After that, once you get experience, you might have a five and an eight.", 
    "Even at Pivotal Labs, 8 is extremely rare.", 
    "How do you assign the points?", 
    "Rock, paper, scissors.", 
    "So when you meet with your team, called the scrum, and what you do is,", 
    "when you got the story, you do everybody vote-- one, two, three.", 
    "Because you want everybody participating to estimate what the", 
    "story is, and then you take the average.", 
    "Now hopefully, there's three twos, a one, and a three, and that seems like", 
    "a pretty good average.", 
    "But if there's big disagreements there, then you don't just take the", 
    "average, we'll make that three and a half you talk some more to try and", 
    "understand why there's such a divergence there.", 
    "And that's the idea.", 
    "Our advice, or at least the experience at, I think, Pivotal Labs, what you're", 
    "trying to do is do stories that you complete each iteration.", 
    "So if it's five points or more, probably, you should break them up", 
    "into simpler stories, so you don't get this giant backlog.", 
    "And then as long as you get good at assigning points, and you do that", 
    "relatively consistently over time, you'll become predictable at software", 
    "development, which is a very cool thing to have.", 
    "And it doesn't matter whether you're doing 5 or 10 points of the week.", 
    "It just matters that your team is assigning points accurately, and then", 
    "have a consistent, predictable number of points per week.", 
    "So one of the things I really admire about the course that Armando's put", 
    "together, is, rather than the software engineering course that I took, where", 
    "it was a lot of preaching, you should do this.", 
    "You should do that.", 
    "And then we were supposed to follow what the faculty member said and", 
    "probably really did that-- there's tools for", 
    "everything we tell you about.", 
    "So one of the cool tools, and we just talked to you about", 
    "Pivotal Labs, is Tracker.", 
    "And so Pivotal Labs made this thing called Tracker.", 
    "And what it does, it's a very simple tool, it just keeps track of your user", 
    "stories for you.", 
    "So if you're supposed to be writing down user stories, well, wouldn't it", 
    "be nice if there's a place that kept track of user stories.", 
    "And that it kept track of the points per user story.", 
    "And then it could keep track at the rate that you completed those user", 
    "stories, and it would calculate things.", 
    "Alas, my dog is hiding the points there, but up in this right hand", 
    "corner of this tool called Pivotal Tracker is 10 points.", 
    "So the average of this team over the time of this project is", 
    "10 points per iteration.", 
    "So given that you've got all these points here, then we've got these", 
    "different panels for doing things.", 
    "This one is called, it's covered up, I think that's the back log.", 
    "Well, these are where all the stories go into, from which you pick them, and", 
    "you put them in prioritized order, and then they're placed into the current", 
    "panel that you're working on them.", 
    "And then, when they're done, there's a done panel here.", 
    "Now there's also something called the Icebox, which is an", 
    "unordered list, is--", 
    "working with customers, you're going to come up with all", 
    "kinds of user stories.", 
    "Always, there's going to be more user stories than you can finish, so you", 
    "throw them in the icebox, so that you don't forget them.", 
    "You don't want somebody suggesting them again in the future.", 
    "So that then you go to the ice box, which ones do you want to work on now,", 
    "and, in talking with the customer, you put them into the backlog and the", 
    "priority to order.", 
    "And then what can happen, you figure out who's going to work on them when", 
    "you start working on them, is, as you move things from the current list to", 
    "the done list, and we'll talk about what the mechanism are to do that,", 
    "then the new stories can pop in from the back log.", 
    "So that's it.", 
    "That's a pretty simple piece of software.", 
    "You could imagine building that yourselves.", 
    "But just because it's simple doesn't mean it's not really useful.", 
    "And I think these next things I said that.", 
    "They're in priorities order, except in Icebox.", 
    "And then they also had the idea, one of the things that'll typically happen", 
    "when you're work with the customer is, you have a major release, right?", 
    "Version 3.0, we're going to have all these features.", 
    "Well, you can associate a bunch of stories.", 
    "You say that's going to be with the release, and you can stick release", 
    "points into your lab.", 
    "So in the prioritized order, you've got to get all these stories done, and", 
    "here's a release point.", 
    "Well, since there's point associated with all the stories, and Pivotal", 
    "Tracker is calculating it for you, you can see how long it'll take that to", 
    "get to the release point.", 
    "So rather than somebody like me tells you, we're going to ship on April 1,", 
    "and then you work like crazy the last two weeks of March because we made up", 
    "April 1 as the deadline.", 
    "And then you're late, and it doesn't work.", 
    "This way, every time you meet with the customer, when's that", 
    "release going to happen?", 
    "Well, it looks like now it's going to be March 23 right now, now looks like", 
    "it'll be April 15th.", 
    "So it calculates that for you.", 
    "And then they've added another idea, since we started talking about that.", 
    "And that's one of the things about this Rails environment that we're", 
    "using, they're always coming up with new tools and new features.", 
    "They added a new feature called an Epic, which has its own panel.", 
    "And it's the idea that, often, there'd be a bunch of related user stories.", 
    "And you'd like to get an idea how you're doing on these", 
    "related user stories.", 
    "And that's what they call an Epic.", 
    "And they group these things together.", 
    "Who moves things over?", 
    "Just like the scrum, there's a product owner.", 
    "Remember the product owner rule from scrum?", 
    "That gets brought over here to Pivotal Tracker because", 
    "Pivotal Labs uses scrum.", 
    "The developers don't decide when the user stories are done.", 
    "They push a button that says I think this story is done.", 
    "And then the team member who is acting as the product owner", 
    "decides if it's done.", 
    "And the product owner will try out the story and then hit either the Accept,", 
    "so it is done, and it moves to the done pile, or Reject, and explain why,", 
    "and then that goes back to the developers.", 
    "So they kind of bring in the scrum back into this design.", 
    "So we use it for our book.", 
    "When Armando or I come up with an idea that we want the other guy to", 
    "implement, we go to assign a story, we write the story.", 
    "And I assign it to Armando for him to work on, or he assigns it to me.", 
    "And then we move it from the backlog to the current plan, and when there's", 
    "things I am supposed to be doing, they'll be done.", 
    "And what Armando is showing is, this is edX.", 
    "So this is the platform that the massive online open course", 
    "is using for 169.1.", 
    "And you can see the four panels there, the rightmost is the Epics, it's the", 
    "one I just talked about.", 
    "Why don't you talk, you may know what's here.", 
    "ARMANDO FOX: So I just thought it would be interesting to show you an", 
    "example of an active project in Pivotal Tracker.", 
    "Just to kind of give us an overview of what's going on, this", 
    "is the Epics panel.", 
    "And I just opened one of the Epics, which has to do with design, how do", 
    "you design a course.", 
    "So these are all the individual stories that have to do with that", 
    "particular Epic.", 
    "The Icebox is the stories that haven't yet been prioritize and sorted.", 
    "Current is the stories are being worked on, you can see that there's", 
    "different initials next to some of the stories, which developers is", 
    "responsible for each story.", 
    "You can see that some of them have been delivered, and they're waiting", 
    "for the product or to accept or reject it.", 
    "You can see progress over the last, roughly, twelve iterations, and here's", 
    "a release milestone.", 
    "These are things are supposed to happen before the internal", 
    "release on October 5.", 
    "So hopefully it's OK that I'm showing this, I guess we'll find out.", 
    "Well, here there's 19 points were completed in this iteration over here.", 
    "Oh, the average velocity?", 
    "There we go.", 
    "The average velocity is 19.", 
    "And this is a pretty aggressive group.", 
    "So Dave mentioned we use this for all kinds of internal stuff.", 
    "This is my Pivotal Tracker account, this is the list of", 
    "projects that I'm on.", 
    "Some of them are my own projects, some of them are related to edX, a couple", 
    "of them are projects in this course where I'm the customer.", 
    "And some of them are just sort of things that, even though they're not", 
    "software, like book writing, we use it for that too.", 
    "So, Swiss Army Knife.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: All right, with that, I think we'll go back to the slides", 
    "and, so a couple of other things that aren't so much points related is,", 
    "besides Tracker, which is really helpful for helping you plan, and", 
    "estimate, and figure out what's the most important thing to work on,", 
    "there's other things you need as a team, like places to store things.", 
    "One of the things is, Tracker allows you to attach", 
    "documents to user stories.", 
    "So you could attach here, if you had an image of your LoFi interface, you", 
    "mocked it up and took a photo of it, you could attach it to that.", 
    "Github has a Wiki that you can use.", 
    "That seems like useful goes along with your source code.", 
    "Probably everybody here uses Google Documents.", 
    "We certainly do for a set of people to edit and see and document them,", 
    "spreadsheets, drawings, all kinds of things.", 
    "And then you'd like to have a place to talk things over.", 
    "Campfire is one that we would recommend.", 
    "It's a password protected chat room, so you can be", 
    "conversing as you go along.", 
    "So in terms of things to help teams be successful, here are some places for", 
    "storage, plus Pivotal Tracker, and user points, and stories.", 
    "And with that, we are ready to ask you a question.", 
    "All right, so which of these is true?", 
    "When comparing two teams, the one with the higher velocity is more", 
    "productive.", 
    "When you don't know how to approach a given user story, just", 
    "give it three points.", 
    "With Tracker, developers pick the user stories, and mark as", 
    "accepted when done.", 
    "And Tracker help prioritize and track user stories and their status,", 
    "calculates velocity, and predicts software development time."
