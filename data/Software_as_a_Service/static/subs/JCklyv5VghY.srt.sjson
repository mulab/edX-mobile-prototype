    "ARMANDO FOX: OK, there has been some convergence toward orange, although", 
    "it's by no means unanimous.", 
    "Orange is indeed a poor choice.", 
    "Suppose you only want to migrate a few records at the time, but because", 
    "you're putting this in a file that has nothing to do with any table, it's", 
    "sort of completely on or completely off, and doesn't give you the", 
    "selectivity of doing--", 
    "That is true, however, there's actually an even more straightforward", 
    "reason why I would advise not putting a feature flag value into a YAML file.", 
    "What's the one thing you have to be able to do with a feature flag in", 
    "order for it to do its job?", 
    "Turn it on and off.", 
    "More specifically, turn it on and off when?", 
    "While the app is running, right?", 
    "So the problem with putting it in a YAML file is yeah, you could put it", 
    "there, but you're probably going to have to restart the app to get it to", 
    "re-read that file to realize the flag has changed.", 
    "And in fact, the config directory is probably", 
    "replicated on all the servers.", 
    "So you actually haven't achieved the goal of being able to sort of", 
    "instantaneously change the value of the feature flag in a way that becomes", 
    "very quickly visible to all of the app servers.", 
    "Whereas if you put it either in an existing table or in a separate table", 
    "just for feature flags, because so far in our deployment architecture,", 
    "everybody sees the same view of the database, pretty much you can change", 
    "the value of the flag back and forth instantaneously, and", 
    "everybody sees it.", 
    "Right, so roughly speaking, anywhere in the file system is probably bad,", 
    "because there's no way for you sort of give the app a kick to say reread the", 
    "config file, right?", 
    "That's something that happens once at start up, and it never", 
    "really happens again.", 
    "Plus you'd have to make sure that you copy the new config file value to each", 
    "one of the servers, and now you're kind of back where you started of no,", 
    "we actually want to be able to do it almost atomically.", 
    "So remember, the key thing about the feature flag is can you change its", 
    "value at run time and immediately change the behavior", 
    "of your code, right?", 
    "If you can't do that, then you should be thinking about where else", 
    "you might put it.", 
    "OK, so I promised to do a computer history minute.", 
    "So let me do that now.", 
    "This is a computer for which I have an unusual soft spot in my heart.", 
    "Probably because it was the first somewhat serious computer that I", 
    "owned, and I learned to program on it, and stuff like that.", 
    "In fact, if any of you have been to my office in Soda Hall, I have one of", 
    "these sitting on my desk.", 
    "It's on the campus network.", 
    "It has an ethernet card that is much more powerful than the computer", 
    "itself, but it does work.", 
    "I brought some interesting paraphernalia that you", 
    "can look at, too.", 
    "This is a advertisement from the late 1970s.", 
    "This guy is looking at some graphs that have no x or y-axes.", 
    "But it shows you can use a computer to look at graphs.", 
    "I don't know why she's hanging out back here instead of--", 
    "I don't know why his computer's on the kitchen table, for that matter.", 
    "But computers were sold differently then, right?", 
    "This is an ad that appeared in sort of a popular press magazine,", 
    "like Time or Newsday.", 
    "This is how computers were sold.", 
    "People were expected actually read all this stuff.", 
    "Yeah, so Apple-- well, I think Radio Shack did ads.", 
    "Radio Shack did TRS-80 ads.", 
    "And they were going to sell the TRS-80 through Radio Shack to consumers.", 
    "But Apple was certainly among the first to really design the computer to", 
    "look like a consumer product, and to target consumer ads with bright", 
    "colors, and I don't know what these people are doing down here.", 
    "But anyway, look, it was the '70s.", 
    "And by the way, there is a demo about to be shown behind this.", 
    "This is just kind of the set up.", 
    "This is the exposition.", 
    "So by today's standards, the mighty 6502, which in my view, deserves", 
    "credit for really launching the personal computer industry.", 
    "I know that it was not the processor in the IBM PC, nor was it the one in", 
    "the, what people think of as the first hobbyist computer, the Altair.", 
    "But more personal computers were sold with 6502s than any other processors", 
    "combined up until the IBM PC clone revolution began.", 
    "You could get from 4 to 48 k-bytes RAM.", 
    "K-bytes.", 
    "There was a BASIC interpreter built into ROM.", 
    "So in those days, most hobbyist computers used BASIC because it was", 
    "one of the few languages that had been squeezed down into a form that would", 
    "actually fit into a machine that had this much RAM.", 
    "So there was no reason to--", 
    "most of these computers, if you bought them, you didn't get a disk drive", 
    "right away, because they were expensive.", 
    "So you'd have to have something useful in ROM that would let you get started", 
    "writing code immediately.", 
    "And what most of them had was a BASIC interpreter.", 
    "And what today you would probably call a very primitive BIOS.", 
    "BASIC input and output system.", 
    "Almost no built in I/O. You would connect it to a TV set because", 
    "monitors were quite expensive.", 
    "You could have kind of a 24 line text field, or you could have some very", 
    "primitive graphics modes by today's standards.", 
    "A cassette audio port, which by today's standards, 300 bits per second", 
    "doesn't seem terribly fast.", 
    "But it was faster than the consumer cassette ports of the day.", 
    "And the manual, which I should have brought with me, but maybe I will next", 
    "time included a complete source code listing of the BIOS with comments, and", 
    "it included a hardware schematic fold out, in case you wanted to build it", 
    "yourself, or make changes to it, or something like that.", 
    "So, different times.", 
    "Today, of course, unless you're like me and you have one of these on your", 
    "desktop, it is hard to experience the joy that was trying to program these", 
    "things in BASIC and learn programming by yourself the hard way.", 
    "However, thanks to emulators, I don't know if I can make this any bigger--", 
    "well, that's big enough for you to see.", 
    "I don't know if you can--", 
    "the guy who did this emulator recorded the noise that the disk drive makes", 
    "when it starts up.", 
    "It makes all these clacking noises.", 
    "Unfortunately, I don't have an audio feed for you to hear.", 
    "OK, so what am I doing with this demo?", 
    "I actually am trying to prove a point here.", 
    "Let me hit the soft reset button.", 
    "OK, so now I'm in the BASIC interpreter.", 
    "I could the type lines of a program, and I could sort of", 
    "expect them to work.", 
    "OK, no big deal.", 
    "But suppose that as a neo computer hacker, I have this", 
    "retro computing urge.", 
    "I want to write code and see what it would have been like to write programs", 
    "in the early days.", 
    "But I want to apply modern methodologies, like", 
    "behavior driven design.", 
    "And be able to do my integration test in a repeatable manner on a machine", 
    "where I don't even have an assembler.", 
    "What could I do?", 
    "Well, the other thing that we get.", 
    "So here's a Cucumber feature.", 
    "So here's a couple of Cucumber features.", 
    "One of them is just a Hello World program.", 
    "And the other one's maybe a little bit more sophisticated.", 
    "It's an imperative language.", 
    "Iterative BASIC version of computing Fibonacci numbers.", 
    "So when I see a prompt for--", 
    "I should type in this program.", 
    "When I run it, I should see a prompt.", 
    "I type in a number at the prompt, and I should get the right result.", 
    "So I'm going to run this Cucumber feature against the emulator.", 
    "We'll just run the first one, actually.", 
    "OK, so I do have a point here.", 
    "A few lectures ago, I can't remember if it was during class or if it was", 
    "after class, somebody asked whether tools like Cucumber could be or had", 
    "been used in settings outside of Ruby on Rails SaaS apps.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So people have used it to do iOS stuff.", 
    "People have used it to test JavaScript apps on node.", 
    "But the bottom line is if you can control the thing under test through", 
    "some sort of an interface, whatever that interface may be, and if you can", 
    "mate that interface to Ruby in some way, then you can pretty much write", 
    "features for anything, right?", 
    "In this case I used, my actual step definitions are pretty simple.", 
    "So App Script is a piece of code that allows you to call", 
    "Apple script programs.", 
    "For those of you who don't use Mac OS, Apple Script is this scripting", 
    "facility that's built in, that almost all applications expose at least some", 
    "of their operations through Apple script.", 
    "But it's this kind of arcane scripting language, so App Script is a Ruby gem", 
    "that allows you to call Apple Script code from Ruby code.", 
    "And then all I had to do was look at the Apple Script documentation", 
    "associated with the Apple 2 emulator, and find out what primitives were", 
    "available through Apple Script, and just use those same primitives, but", 
    "through Ruby.", 
    "So all I'm doing is before any scenario runs, I instantiate a new", 
    "virtual machine, Apple Script object to talk to.", 
    "After each step, I sleep a little bit because the emulator actually tries to", 
    "be cycle accurate.", 
    "So I have to slow down, so that I don't overwhelm its tiny brain with", 
    "fast input.", 
    "And then my steps, when I clear the screen, well, that's just typing a", 
    "command line at the interpreter.", 
    "I can type a line to the interpreter.", 
    "I can enter a program.", 
    "Booting is pretty easy.", 
    "There's a reset method that is exposed through the Apple Script interface.", 
    "And then for the output steps, for the --there we go--", 
    "the only one that I used in this case was what should I see?", 
    "And basically, I just get the entire block of screen text as a big array of", 
    "strings, and I just search for a regular expression.", 
    "So this is a simple process, but you'd be amazed at what you can", 
    "use Cucumber for.", 
    "So when you leave this class, you do other things, you leave the wonderful", 
    "sheltered framework of the Ruby on Rails testing tools, you can take some", 
    "of it with you."
