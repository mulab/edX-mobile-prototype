    "ARMANDO FOX: So roughly speaking, it's the weakest link in the chain", 
    "argument, right?", 
    "Whichever of these has the lowest availability, I can't possibly have my", 
    "perception of availability be better than that.", 
    "And, I'm not going to comment on which one of these it is in my situation,", 
    "but I'll let you guys guess.", 
    "It's not proportional to the maximum availability because if more", 
    "availability is better--", 
    "in the limit, if Comcast was available 1% of the time, which is only slightly", 
    "worse than--", 
    "Anyway, if Comcast was available only 1% of the time, it wouldn't matter how", 
    "good these two were.", 
    "My perceived ability to use the app would be impacted by the minimum one.", 
    "And this is not necessarily true-- it may be true in this case.", 
    "It may be true that, in general, Comcast is less reliable than Heroku", 
    "is less reliable than my app.", 
    "I wouldn't bet on it.", 
    "But there's nothing to support that this is true in this case.", 
    "OK, so the greens have it.", 
    "Good job greens.", 
    "So let's talk about availability and responsiveness as the first set of", 
    "metrics that really matter.", 
    "The gold standard for availability was set by the US public phone system,", 
    "which had a goal of being 99.999% available.", 
    "That means that fewer than one time in a million that you picked up the phone", 
    "would you not get a dial tone and be ready to make a call.", 
    "So this is often called 5 nines.", 
    "And if you actually do the math, it turns out that that's about", 
    "5 minutes per year.", 
    "So it makes it pretty easy.", 
    "If you subtract a nine, that's 50 minutes a year.", 
    "If you went to 6 nines, that'd be 0.5 minutes per year.", 
    "But each nine is an order of magnitude.", 
    "So, a good internet service these days gets 3 or 4 nines.", 
    "Although jokingly, one of the best books that I've found on operations", 
    "called, Release It, says that most services are closer to 2 eights or 3", 
    "eights, 88.8%.", 
    "But if your first two numbers aren't nine nine, you're", 
    "already in orange territory.", 
    "Good internet services get 3 to 4 nines.", 
    "And, as we'll see, that actually depends on the interval over which you", 
    "measure it.", 
    "The response time is, when I do something with the application, when I", 
    "interact with it, how long does it take for me to get a response?", 
    "And what's happened with the worldwide web is that as networks have gotten", 
    "faster, and the things that you communicate have gotten smaller, it's", 
    "dominated by latency.", 
    "So what I mean by that?", 
    "Before the web, the most common usage cases for the wide area internet were", 
    "you would transfer big things.", 
    "You would be transferring large files over long-lived connections.", 
    "If you remember using FTP.", 
    "Or you'd be doing interactive typing just typing across a remote terminal.", 
    "So in a case like that, the dominant factor is not how long it takes to get", 
    "the first byte back, but it's how long it takes to get the whole thing back.", 
    "Even if it takes a few seconds for the first byte to come, most of the time", 
    "is going to be spent downloading the large object, which is still true", 
    "today if you're downloading large files.", 
    "But most of your time spent on the web is not spent downloading large files.", 
    "It's spent downloading things that are a few k bytes.", 
    "Things that, in terms of bits per second, and how long it takes to", 
    "transmit them, is close enough to 0 that the dominant factor is how long", 
    "does it take to get the first byte?", 
    "Because once you've got the first byte, you've probably got the last", 
    "byte within a packet of time or two after that.", 
    "That's changed the demands that have been placed on the network.", 
    "And it also changes how network quality is measured from the point of", 
    "view of people who use it for web apps.", 
    "How important is it to have good response time?", 
    "Amazon, Yahoo, and Google did this combined experiment where they", 
    "artificially introduced delays into the response times from their main", 
    "pages where you would do searches and stuff.", 
    "And Amazon found that if they added 100 milliseconds to the latency, they", 
    "would see a 1% drop in sales.", 
    "That's a lot for Amazon, by the way.", 
    "1% is a lot of Kindles or something.", 
    "Google saw 20% fewer searches when they increased the delay artificially", 
    "by half a second.", 
    "So speed is a feature.", 
    "It's really important that you do everything you can to minimize your", 
    "response time.", 
    "And, in fact, Google's point of view is that their goal is to make it just", 
    "as fast to use Google as to contact them at all.", 
    "So if your Internet experience is dominated by having a slow internet", 
    "provider, their goal is to basically add 0 onto that amount.", 
    "They believe that that's the way that they're going to keep", 
    "their customers happiest.", 
    "What's interesting is that different studies have been done on users'", 
    "perception of what fast response time actually means.", 
    "And I've picked two studies here.", 
    "The first one is the classic one where they did experiments with an", 
    "interactive user interface that if the user interface registered a response", 
    "to an action within 100 milliseconds, the user perceived that as", 
    "instantaneous.", 
    "If they did it within about a second, the user perceived it as sluggish, but", 
    "they still had the sense of cause and effect.", 
    "Like, I did this action, and it caused the UI to do that.", 
    "And about seven to eight seconds is the time after which users get bored", 
    "and their attention starts to drift away.", 
    "And the 7 second rule, or the 8 second rule, has actually been independently", 
    "re-verified in a couple of different web studies in the", 
    "last 10 or so years.", 
    "Now, if you're routinely taking seven or eight seconds that's way above", 
    "threshold for most sites now anyway.", 
    "But what's interesting is that these seem to be constants related to your", 
    "attention span.", 
    "So the 7 second rule has been remarkably stable for decades.", 
    "Here is the false view of performance that we often wish we had.", 
    "We draw our nice bell curve, a standard normal distribution.", 
    "And we say, well, the average response time, whatever the average of this is,", 
    "then as long as 95% of the users, let's say, are captured in this part", 
    "of the curve, then most of those users--", 
    "95% of the users are getting something that's within two sigma of the average", 
    "response time.", 
    "So that's fine.", 
    "There's what the average user gets and there's what most users get.", 
    "The problem with the picture is that in real life, for reasons having to do", 
    "with network engineering and systems software engineering, the curves that", 
    "represent the distributions of response times don't look", 
    "like that at all.", 
    "This is from an experimental service that we built in the Rad Lab, a", 
    "database called SCADS.", 
    "And measuring over a large number of responses, what was the", 
    "mean response time?", 
    "It's an admirable 17 milliseconds.", 
    "90% of the users had response times of 34 milliseconds.", 
    "So that's double the mean.", 
    "And if you wanted to ask, what experience are 99%", 
    "of the users having?", 
    "Then, it was almost five times the mean.", 
    "So, in fact, the distribution of response times in real life is not", 
    "according to this symmetric bell curve.", 
    "It's usually something like this, where you could measure the average,", 
    "but the average isn't useful.", 
    "Because it doesn't tell you about the experience that", 
    "most people are having.", 
    "Most people are not centered in this chunk of mass around the average", 
    "because the shape of the curve is wrong.", 
    "So to compensate for that, the definition of a service level", 
    "objective is in terms of the time to satisfy user requests.", 
    "And we'll call that the latency or the response time.", 
    "And rather than talking about the average user, or the worst case user,", 
    "we talk about what percentage of users.", 
    "So a typical specification would say 99% of the users should see a response", 
    "time of under 1 second over any given 5 minute window.", 
    "By the way, why is it important to say over any five minute window?", 
    "What if we didn't say that and we had a really bad day.", 
    "But the right answer is that you could cheat.", 
    "If you had a really bad five minute interval where only 90% of the users", 
    "got acceptable response time, you could just say, oh yeah, that's fine.", 
    "Wait 10 more minutes.", 
    "And over those 10 minutes you'll see that it'll be great.", 
    "And if you had a really bad 10 minutes, you could say,", 
    "just wait till tomorrow.", 
    "And average the measurements over a whole day, then it'll be great.", 
    "So you have to include some notion of what the time window is.", 
    "And, by the way, there's confusion.", 
    "Some people call it a service level agreement.", 
    "The SLO is the mathematical expression of what you must do.", 
    "The SLA is what the lawyers pull out to penalize you.", 
    "They hit you over the head with it when you don't do it.", 
    "So technically, the SLA is the legal contract.", 
    "The SLO is the numerical specification of what you're trying to achieve.", 
    "But for most people that's too complicated.", 
    "So here's the simple version.", 
    "The simpler version is called Apdex.", 
    "And it's a way to compute what really comes out to a simplified service", 
    "level objective.", 
    "And the idea is you determine a threshold latency for user", 
    "satisfaction.", 
    "How you determine it is up to you.", 
    "You could do a survey.", 
    "You could look in the literature.", 
    "You could use the 7 second rule.", 
    "And any request that takes less than that amount of time is satisfactory.", 
    "If it takes more than that amount of time, but less than 4 times that", 
    "amount, it's tolerable.", 
    "So we're trying to simulate the idea that the mass of the distribution is", 
    "not centered around the mean.", 
    "And then, you add up the number of satisfactory ones and you get half", 
    "credit for all the tolerable ones.", 
    "The mean of that over the total number of requests is your Apdex score.", 
    "So a perfect Apdex score of 100 or 1.0 means that all of the requests were", 
    "satisfactory.", 
    "They all completed within the service threshold.", 
    "There's examples in the book that you can work out of an Apdex score less", 
    "than about 0.85.", 
    "0.85 is considered a warning mark.", 
    "If your Apdex x goes below 0.85 you might want to take a look.", 
    "If it goes below 0.7, something is probably really wrong.", 
    "Now, how did people come up with 0.7 and 0.85?", 
    "Well, it's probably just as honest to say that once 0.85 was decided on as a", 
    "rule of thumb, people started tweaking their t constants, so that it was", 
    "never worse than 0.85.", 
    "So don't do that.", 
    "You can game the numbers anyway you want.", 
    "But the bona fide goal here is to give you an approximate sense of an SLO for", 
    "a large site without having to compute the fully general version.", 
    "And I actually want to show you before we depart today a screen", 
    "shot from New Relic.", 
    "We're going to talk about New Relic when we talk about monitoring.", 
    "But this is the new cool way to create monitoring.", 
    "So this is the edX platform on New Relic.", 
    "And, as you can see, we had--", 
    "there was an incident that I was looking at down here.", 
    "There we go.", 
    "Last week, there was an incident where the end user Apdex score", 
    "was less than 0.85.", 
    "We can drill down to that incident.", 
    "OK, so there's the end user average response time.", 
    "You can see these are time stamps corresponding to last week.", 
    "And they've computed the Apdex score--", 
    "sorry about all Javascript-y stuff going on.", 
    "So the warning line is set at 0.85.", 
    "I don't know if it was our fault, but I'm willing to bet that it was related", 
    "to homework submission.", 
    "But this is the kind of things that as an app developer you'd want to see.", 
    "So we'll talk about New Relic as an example of another nice way that", 
    "monitoring has changed.", 
    "You used to have to install all this stuff on your own servers.", 
    "Now you don't even have to do that.", 
    "Now you just have plug-ins that send instrumentation to a third party site.", 
    "And you get these really nice user interfaces for browsing it.", 
    "So let's stop there.", 
    "And we'll pick up this discussion on Monday."
