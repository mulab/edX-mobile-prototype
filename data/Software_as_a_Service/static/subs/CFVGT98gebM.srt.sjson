    "DANNY BURKES: OK, as I said, I want to talk about two things,", 
    "first is the practice.", 
    "What does it look like to work at Pivotal?", 
    "What do we do and how is that different than how software is", 
    "developed at other consultancies or even in other enterprises?", 
    "I was trying to come up with what our philosophy is to try to sketch it out", 
    "at a high level.", 
    "And this is what I came up with.", 
    "This is what we believe.", 
    "We believe that software development is about communication.", 
    "And that's another way of saying that it's not about code.", 
    "The code you produce, of course, it's a means to an end.", 
    "But to get better, you have to learn.", 
    "And to learn, you have to communicate.", 
    "The ability to talk to and learn from other human beings is critical to", 
    "doing well at software development.", 
    "Software development takes discipline and rigor.", 
    "And by that I mean, we have these methods that we use.", 
    "We pair all the time.", 
    "We do 100% TDD.", 
    "We always use CI.", 
    "We always use Tracker.", 
    "We continue doing this because we see that it works.", 
    "But we're also very unwilling to compromise on these things.", 
    "So, as I said, when clients come to us and do engagements, we insist that", 
    "they do it our way, mostly because we're only sure that we'll be able to", 
    "produce a good result if they do it our way.", 
    "And we really want to produce good results, because if we don't, our", 
    "reputation suffers.", 
    "And then our business goes down the tubes.", 
    "So, we don't want that.", 
    "Software development process is never perfected.", 
    "Part of our process involves having retrospectives usually on a weekly", 
    "basis in projects.", 
    "And what a retrospective is is just a 1 hour meeting at which all the", 
    "developers, and the PM, and maybe a representative from the client get in", 
    "a room and talk very openly and directly about what is going well, and", 
    "what is starting to look a little fishy, and what is not going well.", 
    "And the things that are not going well, we want to talk about in detail", 
    "for up to an hour, and then get some action items out of that for how to", 
    "fix those things.", 
    "Within the project, we're doing this on a weekly basis.", 
    "Within the company, we're doing this on a monthly basis to talk about, hey,", 
    "we're still doing pairing all the time.", 
    "Is that really working?", 
    "I don't foresee the time when somebody would raise their hand and say, no, we", 
    "shouldn't do that anymore.", 
    "But it's possible.", 
    "Everything's on the table.", 
    "None of this is canon.", 
    "Finally, software development is never finished.", 
    "This is obvious to anybody that develops software is that", 
    "you're never done.", 
    "You've got to respond to customers and what people want.", 
    "And you can't guess that.", 
    "The only way you can get that information is to put it out there.", 
    "So, you want to be continuously iterating on products.", 
    "But that last point about it never being finished is directly in conflict", 
    "with this notion that you can develop software from a spec.", 
    "Because if you can develop software from a spec, then you", 
    "know when you're done.", 
    "We just don't believe that.", 
    "Our experience is, it just doesn't work.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: Let me ask you this, when Pivotal started, has it always", 
    "been agile in XP, or did it have other--", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Pivotal has been around for a long time.", 
    "Pivotal has been around for more than 20 years.", 
    "And the agile stuff is late '90s, early 2000s.", 
    "There was a time before agile that Pivotal did software development using", 
    "a methodology that I can't speak to.", 
    "Because I don't know what it was.", 
    "The Pivotal brand has been around longer than agile.", 
    "But I think what Pivotal is known for today, the reputation in the", 
    "marketplace, is all based on agile.", 
    "I talked about a lot of this stuff already.", 
    "We do all pairing all the time.", 
    "All TDD, all the time.", 
    "Strong focus on refactoring.", 
    "That just means let's improve the code while keeping the behavior the same.", 
    "And that's not possible unless you do TDD.", 
    "Unless you have a test suite, you cannot effectively refactor software.", 
    "We do CI all the time.", 
    "Day one of every client engagement, we set up a", 
    "continuous integration server.", 
    "And every time the code is pushed, all the tests are run.", 
    "And if it fails, we have big monitors in the office, people get embarrassed.", 
    "They go fix things.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: Why the monitors?", 
    "Well, because they--", 
    "DANNY BURKES: The monitors, well, there's a history behind the monitors.", 
    "A few years ago, the monitors were for the developers so they could look up", 
    "and see if the tests were red or green.", 
    "These days, everybody just has a little indicator up on their menu", 
    "bars, red or green.", 
    "The monitors these days are actually for clients and for people who come", 
    "visit the office.", 
    "They like to see these big monitors with these red and green screens, ooh,", 
    "that's cool.", 
    "But the point is we're doing CI.", 
    "And the developers get direct and immediate feedback when they break", 
    "things, if they break things.", 
    "Co-located teams, as I mentioned, number one, we insist that all the", 
    "engagements happen in our office.", 
    "And number two, we ask the client developers to come work there", 
    "and pair with us.", 
    "And the client PM, which is the product manager, the product owner you", 
    "might have heard it called--", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: We talk about Scrum.", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Yes, Scrum says product owner.", 
    "It's basically the same idea.", 
    "Somebody who understands the business priorities and how to understand", 
    "what's important to be happening right now and make those decisions on an", 
    "hour-by-hour basis.", 
    "Stand-up, we do a stand-up every morning in the company.", 
    "It usually lasts about 10 minutes.", 
    "And then we break apart into teams, and they all do a stand-up, again,", 
    "about 10 minutes.", 
    "It's important just to keep that communication--", 
    "the project stand-ups are mostly about, hey, is there anything that you", 
    "need to do today that you're blocked on?", 
    "Is there something I can help you with so you don't waste your time today?", 
    "The company-wide stand-ups is mostly about, hey, my project has this", 
    "problem we're facing.", 
    "And we can't figure it out.", 
    "But, hey, there's 150 other people in this company, has anybody", 
    "else ever seen this?", 
    "That's mostly about inter-project communication.", 
    "When you get that many smart people in a room, usually somebody has seen", 
    "before what you're having a problem with.", 
    "It's a great resource.", 
    "Retrospectives, I talked about that already.", 
    "Proximity of the PM, yes, we ask the PM to come work with us.", 
    "So, when the developers have questions about stories like, hey, you said you", 
    "wanted a password reset feature, but I'm not exactly sure.", 
    "How do you want this to operate?", 
    "Or, hey, we could implement exactly what you asked us to do and it would", 
    "take three days.", 
    "But if we can make this one little tweak, we think we can do", 
    "it in half a day.", 
    "Is that OK with you?", 
    "I mean, is that OK with you is a way of asking them, is that", 
    "right for your business?", 
    "That's not a technical decision.", 
    "It's about their product and their business.", 
    "So, we need somebody there who understands their business and has the", 
    "authority to say yes or no.", 
    "And we don't want that conversation to take place over email, or Skype, or", 
    "IM, or anything.", 
    "We want humans looking at each other talking.", 
    "Tracker, we use Pivotal Tracker for all of our projects.", 
    "Kinda makes sense.", 
    "Demo environment, so part of Tracker--", 
    "I think you guys are using Tracker in here, right?--", 
    "part of the evolution of a story is that it goes into this state where the", 
    "PM needs to accept it or reject it.", 
    "And the way that that happens in practice is that we are deploying the", 
    "software many, many times a day up to a demo environment, which to us is", 
    "usually a one dyno Heroku instance, where the PM can go and try this", 
    "feature that we said was developed and either accept it or reject it.", 
    "Weekly iteration planning, yeah, Tracker.", 
    "You talked about Scrum, usually two week iterations.", 
    "Tracker is one week iterations.", 
    "Once per week we get together, the entire dev team and the PM, to talk", 
    "about what are the stories that the developers should be working on next", 
    "week, and run through each want to make sure the developers understand", 
    "what those stories mean, and have the developers estimate those stories so", 
    "the PM understands what the relative cost is and what the implications are", 
    "for their schedule.", 
    "Inceptions, outceptions, inception is what we call this meeting that we do", 
    "at the beginning of a project.", 
    "Day one, we do a full-day meeting.", 
    "Our day-to-day philosophy is you should avoid meetings at all costs.", 
    "Never do meetings unless somebody makes you do meetings.", 
    "Because we're software developers, I don't have a degree in meetings.", 
    "I don't want to do meetings.", 
    "To enable that, we try to front-load all the meetings.", 
    "We do this day-long meeting on day one where we talk in great detail about", 
    "the product and the product they want to build.", 
    "And we write 50, 100, 150 stories to take us out as far, hopefully, out to", 
    "MVP, the thing they actually want to ship.", 
    "Maybe not that far, but at least a few weeks.", 
    "We want to get at least a few weeks of runway for the developers without", 
    "having to waste their time in the coming weeks.", 
    "We try to do that all upfront.", 
    "Outceptions is a silly word somebody at Pivotal invented, which basically", 
    "means at the end of a project we want to formally deliver to", 
    "the client some advice.", 
    "And that is, like, hey, this Friday is the last day for you guys.", 
    "And here's what we see is your biggest risk after you leave here.", 
    "That might take the form of your developers are not really good enough", 
    "to do what you want or you've got the wrong person as PM.", 
    "They don't understand your business priorities.", 
    "Or you guys are doing great.", 
    "You're going to kill it.", 
    "We love you.", 
    "We want to be very frank about that.", 
    "Because they came to us for frankness.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: Who do you deliver that to?", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Sometimes it's the PM.", 
    "It kind of depends on the shape of the client.", 
    "If the client's a start-up, the PM is usually one of the two co-founders.", 
    "Because they don't have anybody else to do it.", 
    "You may be delivering this advice to the CEO.", 
    "Or in an engagement with a larger company, it may be some product", 
    "manager or product analyst.", 
    "I've seen every ridiculous title you can think of", 
    "represented in that meeting.", 
    "But, hopefully, it's somebody who will listen and deliver the advice to", 
    "somebody can do something about it.", 
    "Let's talk about development culture.", 
    "That last bullet list was all about, what are the tactics?", 
    "How do we develop better software?", 
    "But, culturally, XP has just as many cultural implications as tactical", 
    "implications of how to write the software.", 
    "Let's talk about what some of those are and why these present to clients", 
    "as, not problems, but challenges.", 
    "How does XP look different for developers from normal software", 
    "developer practice?", 
    "Number one, coding is now a social activity.", 
    "If you're the person who likes to put the headphones on and go in the corner", 
    "for 14 hours and crank out 10,000 lines of code, XP is not for you.", 
    "Because in XP you're actually expected to talk to people.", 
    "Design becomes an ongoing activity.", 
    "You're not going to get a design and say, here it is, please go build this.", 
    "What you're going to get is wire frames for a few pages, maybe visual", 
    "design for a few pages.", 
    "And you're going to say, hey, go run with this while we design the rest of", 
    "this thing.", 
    "And you're going to get designs delivered just in time.", 
    "So, you're going to see PSDs and PNGs attached to stories in Tracker.", 
    "When the story is written, there will be no design around it.", 
    "But by the time you pick up that story, by the time you work your way", 
    "down the backlog to that story, there will be a design attached to it.", 
    "I mean, you hope.", 
    "It usually works that way.", 
    "But the idea that we're starting development without a", 
    "full design is different.", 
    "And some people aren't comfortable with that.", 
    "Testing becomes central to coding.", 
    "We do all TDD, so you're not coding unless you're testing.", 
    "In fact, you're always testing before you're coding.", 
    "And the value to the client--", 
    "the tests are actually much, much more valuable to the client than the code.", 
    "This is surprising to people when they first hear it.", 
    "But the code is kind of an artifact.", 
    "The tests say what the client wants to do and the way the client wants the", 
    "product to behave.", 
    "The code is just the implementation of that.", 
    "And the idea of agile software development is that you should be able", 
    "to change the implementation at any time, as long as the tests still pass.", 
    "If you can refactor to a better implementation, that maybe six months", 
    "after you release the product, you're having scaling problems because you", 
    "correctly didn't try to solve the scale problem when you shipped.", 
    "You just wanted to ship and get it into people's hands and let them tell", 
    "you what they liked and what was crappy about it.", 
    "Six months down the line, you've actually got some traction.", 
    "And you got a lot of customers.", 
    "And now you're having response time problems on your site, or something", 
    "that's a symptom of scale problems.", 
    "You may have to reimplement huge parts of the system.", 
    "But as long as you have the test suite, and as long as that test suite", 
    "can assure you that it's still behaving in the same way, you're OK.", 
    "The test suite is much more valuable than the code.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: Do you guys do anything formal about documentation?", 
    "Do you have--", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Tests.", 
    "We don't do comments.", 
    "We don't do docs.", 
    "The tests are the documentation.", 
    "Fortunately, the test frameworks that are kind of in favor these days are", 
    "Spec on the Ruby side, Jasmine for JavaScript.", 
    "Capybara is a thing that sits on top of our spec that let's you do", 
    "integration testing and drive browsers.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: We use Capybara.", 
    "DANNY BURKES: So, all three of those are actually kind of DSL-y things.", 
    "And they read pretty well.", 
    "You don't have to be a programmer, necessarily, to read this and know", 
    "what it's saying.", 
    "That helps a lot.", 
    "But even before that we weren't producing formal documentation.", 
    "Because it's out of date as soon as you publish it.", 
    "This is agile software development, right?", 
    "It's just a waste of time.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: We have friends who are good programmers who argue with us", 
    "about comments.", 
    "But that's not arguing.", 
    "DANNY BURKES: I mean, what are comments for, they're for the next", 
    "person who comes along to understand what was happening here or even maybe", 
    "for me, six months later, so I can remember what was going on there.", 
    "But I think a test is a much better expression of that.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: When we have these arguments he argues, explain why you", 
    "did something, as opposed to what you did.", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Well, why I did it was because I wanted the test to past.", 
    "That's the only reason I ever write code is to make tests pass.", 
    "I write the test to say how I want the system to behave.", 
    "And there is no reason for any code to exist unless it existed", 
    "to make a test pass.", 
    "There's very little private time.", 
    "At Pivotal we don't have our own desks.", 
    "We don't have our own computers.", 
    "What we have is a project team that may be-- say, it's a three pair team,", 
    "so, there's six people on the team.", 
    "There are three development stations.", 
    "We used 27-inch iMacs, and a 27-inch secondary monitor, so pretty wide.", 
    "But they fit on one desk.", 
    "Each computer has two keyboards, two pointing devices, because we pair on", 
    "this thing.", 
    "And before every engagement with a client, they're are reimaged.", 
    "Everything is wiped off of them.", 
    "And they are put back to a starting state with all kinds of standard tools", 
    "that we use.", 
    "And then after the engagement's over, they are wiped again.", 
    "We don't put personal stuff on those computers.", 
    "We have email stations around the office that you can use to get your", 
    "email or do personal stuff if you want.", 
    "Two years ago, three, four years ago that actually made sense.", 
    "These days everybody does that on their phone anyway.", 
    "Nobody even uses those things anymore.", 
    "This idea that you don't have a personal machine bothers some people.", 
    "But in my experience, the people who come to work at Pivotal, it bothers", 
    "them for about the first day.", 
    "And then they don't care anymore.", 
    "Last point, a very big point.", 
    "There is less certainty in XP.", 
    "You don't have a spec.", 
    "You don't know what you want to ship.", 
    "Or you know today, but you're almost certain that it's", 
    "going to change tomorrow.", 
    "You have to be comfortable with this idea that you don't", 
    "know when you're done.", 
    "Well, you don't know when you're done, because--", 
    "previous slide-- you're never done.", 
    "What you're just trying to do is just continuously get better.", 
    "You have to give up this notion of being finished.", 
    "And that takes a certain type of personality, somebody that's", 
    "comfortable with that.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: What languages do you program in now?", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Right now, all of our web development is done in Rails.", 
    "And then we do mobile development on iOS in Android, also.", 
    "The languages there, you're kind of constricted; Objective-C and Java.", 
    "We don't have choice there.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: Not much in Javascript?", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Oh, yeah, the web engagements all involve Javascript.", 
    "These days, more and more so.", 
    "18 months ago, we probably didn't have a Backbone project in the office.", 
    "Now, 70% of the web engagements are very heavily Backbone.", 
    "Things are--", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: Backbone is--", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Backbone is a JavaScript framework to do", 
    "rich client-side stuff.", 
    "And all of our web engagements are moving more and more towards that.", 
    "How does XP look different to PMs?", 
    "You have to maintain a backlog.", 
    "It's a lot of work.", 
    "Clients come to us, and they have a PM.", 
    "Yeah, this is the person who knows what we want to build.", 
    "Just ask them if you have a question.", 
    "Otherwise, they're going to be over here doing their email.", 
    "No, that won't work.", 
    "They have to work every day to make sure that the backlog accurately", 
    "reflects, number one, what they want to build, and number two, the order in", 
    "which they want to build it.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: You talking about the Pivotal screen backlog?", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Yes, the Tracker backlog.", 
    "And it's a lot of work.", 
    "And as the team gets larger, it's more and more work.", 
    "I have seen PMs who could effectively manage an eight pair project.", 
    "But they are very rare.", 
    "It is a lot of work to keep eight pairs busy.", 
    "Developers bug you daily to accept their work.", 
    "Developers are just iterating and writing code and delivering stories.", 
    "And they get annoyed when they deliver a story and they come in tomorrow and", 
    "you haven't accepted or rejected it.", 
    "We want this really tight loop.", 
    "And so, again, it's a time commitment that we find that PMs aren't", 
    "necessarily aware of when they come to Pivotal, like, what do you mean I have", 
    "to be there for eight hours a day?", 
    "What do you mean I have to talk to the developers?", 
    "I thought you were just going to ask me questions as questions arise.", 
    "You're expected to think short and long term.", 
    "So, again, like the traditional notion of the PM is if they have this", 
    "long-term vision of what they want to build.", 
    "But we have to ask them on a daily basis, hey, I could save", 
    "you two days here.", 
    "Do you want that?", 
    "Or do you want the thing you actually asked for?", 
    "And the PMs know, hey, I've got this big demo coming up to", 
    "investors next week.", 
    "Let's use Tracker to see what I can actually get done by that date.", 
    "And that involves making trade-offs.", 
    "They have to be comfortable saying no, which is something", 
    "that you have to get--", 
    "you aren't necessarily comfortable with when you start out.", 
    "And you're expected to be integrated with the", 
    "development team, as I mentioned.", 
    "We want them on site.", 
    "We want them sitting beside the developers."
