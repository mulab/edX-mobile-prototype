    "Are they this?", 
    "Are they that?", 
    "I think it all comes down to one thing, which is people.", 
    "And people are the single most important thing in your new job.", 
    "I think they are more important than the company, so where you work.", 
    "They're more important maybe even than what kind of stuff you're working on.", 
    "Because people make up those things.",

    "They make up the code.", 
    "They make up the product.",

    "You want to be the dumbest person on your team at all times.",

    "respect, and you look at them, you're like wow, I feel so dumb next to them,", 
    "you're at the right place.", 
    "Because these people will lift you up.", 
    "You will learn things from them.", 
    "You will grow faster.", 
    "You'll be able to do more than-- if you're the smartest person in the", 
    "room, then how are you going to grow?", 
    "How are you going to keep learning things?", 
    "Nobody's going to be there to teach you.", 
    "So keep that in mind.", 
    "Try to be the dumbest person.", 
    "Try to find really smart people to surround yourself with.",

    "growth, and who you can go to to ask questions.", 
    "And someone who you look up to and you say, OK in 5 years or in 10 years, I", 
    "want to be that person.", 
    "Because that's a mark in the sand that you can keep working towards, and", 
    "someone that can pull you up.", 
    "Something else that's kind of important is trying not to specialize", 
    "right away.", 
    "I know there's some areas you might have interest in based on the classes", 
    "that you've taken.", 
    "But for the most part, you probably don't know exactly", 
    "what you want to do.", 
    "So I would say, try to go to a place where you're able to do something", 
    "really general.", 
    "Because there's so many different areas that you can get into.", 
    "There's little nuanced things in JavaScript.", 
    "You can get into the back-end code.", 
    "You can get into deployment of servers, automation,", 
    "all types of things.", 
    "And if you haven't had a chance to work in any of it, which is usually",

    "get a chance to maybe try to touch all of those areas and see what interests", 
    "you the most.", 
    "Then maybe you can start narrowing your focus from then.", 
    "Once you get the job--", 
    "this is like the most surprising thing to me.", 
    "When you start working, you're going to be like, all right, I graduated", 
    "from Berkeley.", 
    "I am the smartest person in the world.", 
    "I'm so awesome.", 
    "I'm going to go to this job.",

    "And the second day, you're going to feel really dumb.", 
    "And the third day, you're going to feel really, really dumb.", 
    "And it's going to keep--", 
    "it's going to keep going.", 
    "And that's totally normal.", 
    "You were prepared theoretically and academically here for something", 
    "different than working in software.", 
    "There's a lot of things that you're just going to learn through", 
    "experience.", 
    "And you can't get frustrated by that.", 
    "The best thing to do is to learn.", 
    "Keep trying to learn.", 
    "You're not done learning once you leave school.", 
    "So keep asking people questions.", 
    "Don't be afraid to look stupid, to feel stupid.", 
    "Just ask, ask, ask.", 
    "And then eventually you'll stop feeling stupid for the", 
    "most part, I think.", 
    "One more thing once you get to your job--", 
    "I think this is really good to tell Berkeley students, especially.", 
    "You might want to go to a start-up where they work 100-hour work weeks", 
    "and keep this crazy pace that you probably have right now.", 
    "Because I'm sure a lot of your taking 162 and 169 and five math classes, and", 
    "all this stuff.", 
    "And you're just killing yourself every semester.", 
    "But you get a break at the end of every semester.", 
    "You get winter break or you get summer break.", 
    "You get some time to cool down.", 
    "In the work world, you don't really get those breaks.", 
    "So if you keep that pace, you're going to burn out really, really quickly.", 
    "And that's going to suck.", 
    "You're probably going to leave your first job or go backpack around Europe", 
    "for a year or something.", 
    "I don't know.", 
    "It's going to suck.", 
    "So try to slow down.", 
    "There's going to be a lot to learn.", 
    "So you're already going to feel like there's a lot to do.", 
    "But don't try to run at it too fast.", 
    "You're going to be working with people who have been doing it for", 
    "3 or 5 or 10 years.", 
    "And you're going to be like why am I not that good yet?", 
    "I need to work harder.", 
    "I need to learn more.", 
    "But you have to remember, those people have had 3, 5, 10 years", 
    "to get to that point.", 
    "So take it easy--", 
    "work-life balance.", 
    "Get a hobby.", 
    "I know in college you don't have those.", 
    "But in the real world, there's time for that.", 
    "These are just a few resources I kind of threw up here.", 
    "Once you're in your career, I think there's great places to learn.", 
    "Hopefully you'll be at a place with really smart people that", 
    "you can learn from.", 
    "But there might be other things you're interested in learning.", 
    "Or maybe people that you're with don't know all the stuff.", 
    "Or maybe you just want to learn more outside of work.", 
    "These are really great resources--", 
    "meetup.com.", 
    "Does anybody know about this?", 
    "Does anybody use meetup?", 
    "A few people, not very many?", 
    "OK.",

    "They have lots of groups on there.", 
    "They have--", 
    "there's a Ruby group.", 
    "There's Python groups.", 
    "They meet up sometimes a couple times a week, sometimes once a month.", 
    "They'll do talks.", 
    "They'll do workshops, all kinds of things where you can meet and talk to", 
    "people who are in the same community, writing the same language or the same", 
    "framework as you.", 
    "And you can learn new things.", 
    "I really recommend it.", 
    "Another place to go is once you get into whatever you're doing--", 
    "I mean, I'm a Rails developer.", 
    "So I put Rails-specific and Ruby-specific stuff up there.", 
    "But go to conferences, besides just talking to other people at meet ups.", 
    "Conferences are great places to meet people that are rock", 
    "stars in your community.", 
    "They wrote--", 
    "you can meet the guy that wrote the Rails framework, or the queuing system", 
    "that you use.", 
    "And it's really good to talk to people, to network.", 
    "I didn't put this on a slide, but these things are important because", 
    "once you out there, if you want to switch jobs, you're probably not going", 
    "to have the career center with these job postings.", 
    "And it's kind of bleak out in the real world.", 
    "Like, job posting boards are not the place that people go to get work.", 
    "There's some really terrible postings there, and some really bad recruiters", 
    "that just spam you with all kinds of mail.", 
    "I think the place that you're really going to end up getting a job from is", 
    "through your network, your professional network, the people that", 
    "you know at the company that you're applying to, or the people you've met", 
    "at a conference or at a meetup.", 
    "These guys are great resources to you.", 
    "And you'll probably find a much better job by going and talking to the people", 
    "that you've met here that you admire than you would, like some random", 
    "recruiter that just emailed you and said, hey, your", 
    "experience looks great.", 
    "I'd like to shoot you out to these 500 start-up companies."
