    "DAVID PATTERSON: I'm only going to get through one or two of these today, but", 
    "the first one is it takes a team, and I'm going to talk about Scrum.", 
    "And I think I just wanted to say what's interesting about this set of", 
    "the lectures is since I'm old enough to be your grandfather here, so I've", 
    "been here a long time and there's a bunch of stuff that you learn now", 
    "that's going to go away.", 
    "I learned stuff that people can't believe that I learned.", 
    "But there's some things that are going to work just as well.", 
    "You're going to learn now, it's going to work your whole career, and that's", 
    "the team stuff here.", 
    "The stuff with the people skills.", 
    "People aren't going to change very much over the next 50 years, or now", 
    "that steroids are banned maybe they're not going to change that much.", 
    "But getting along with people, how to lead a group of people, how to be", 
    "successful, this is something you're going to want to learn because you're", 
    "going to need it to your whole time.", 
    "So for me, personally, personalizing this team stuff is, I was on the", 
    "wrestling teams both in high school and college, and we won a state", 
    "championship.", 
    "That's me right there.", 
    "That's right.", 
    "Armando said I could wrestle him to the floor, I'm", 
    "pretty sure that's true.", 
    "So, wrestling's an individual sport, so it's kind of weird.", 
    "How did I learn to be a team?", 
    "I just happened to be on teams in high school and college that had really", 
    "great coaches, and they felt that the way to have a successful wrestling", 
    "team is not just a bunch of individual stars but to pull together and figure", 
    "out how you'd root for each other and help each other, and you'd win", 
    "collectively even though you're all individual.", 
    "So somehow from that, I got how to lead teams and form teams and be", 
    "successful.", 
    "So if you look at my career, everything's team oriented.", 
    "I often co-teach like with Armando.", 
    "I've co-authored six books.", 
    "Every one is co-authored like the one with Armando.", 
    "Most of my papers are co-authored.", 
    "The research projects that I've done--", 
    "I've done 10 or 11 five year projects overlapping--", 
    "they're all with multiple [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "So everything I do is with groups of people and I find it more", 
    "effective this way.", 
    "This one is actually, this happened last year.", 
    "This is actually a 50 year reunion.", 
    "This is my good friend who was my best man at my wedding, and I was at his.", 
    "That's him and I almost 50 years apart, and that's our wrestling coach", 
    "who we got together through.", 
    "So this stuff is stuff that--", 
    "the pay attention to this stuff is going to matter your whole career.", 
    "So, you know, some of the programming language stuff's going to come and go,", 
    "but not team oriented things.", 
    "So the interesting thing is now software engineering is a team sport.", 
    "It used to be an individual sport.", 
    "It used to be like the individual wrestlers.", 
    "And there are people I know who were at the state of the art of their", 
    "software at that time that the hero programmer, the individual was the one", 
    ", like Ken Thompson.", 
    "Ken Thomson, the co-inventor of UNIX, he was a Berkeley student.", 
    "Bill Joy.", 
    "He's the guy I mentioned.", 
    "He was one of the founders of Berkeley software, UNIX, kind of the first open", 
    "source project.", 
    "He was a brilliant image programmer.", 
    "He came up with VI over the weekend, the visual editor.", 
    "John Osterhart, who I mentioned, when he was a young faculty member here, he", 
    "wrote a computer aided design tool all by himself that was better than", 
    "anything that was out there.", 
    "So we are now in the post superhero programmer era.", 
    "You don't hear of individuals doing that anymore.", 
    "So I think what's happened is basically, it's the bar of", 
    "functionality and quality is too high for one person to do it all by", 
    "themselves.", 
    "So that era is behind you.", 
    "You don't hear of people doing it alone.", 
    "You hear of Linus Torvalds with Linux, but he, it wasn't just him doing that.", 
    "He's leading a very large group of people in the open source thing.", 
    "So you don't hear that anymore.", 
    "So you have to figure out how to work in groups.", 
    "To have a successful career, you're going to not only have great", 
    "programming chops, but you have to work well with others, and", 
    "help make a team win.", 
    "So what does help making a team win?", 
    "This is Fred Brooks, one of our heroes in computing.", 
    "He's quoting his basketball coach at University o North Carolina.", 
    "He said there are no winners on a losing team, and no losers on a", 
    "winning team.", 
    "So if your team, you have to do it takes to make your team win.", 
    "You can't be, well, I was fine, but the other guys sucked, so I did OK.", 
    "That's not how teams work.", 
    "The teams collectively work together, and you have to figure that out.", 
    "And this is a thing that the feedback we get from industry, that people care", 
    "a lot about teams.", 
    "As how do you learn how to work with teams.", 
    "Now, the good news, and one of the things that [INAUDIBLE] and I are", 
    "excited about teaching the course this way is that software has been", 
    "reinvented in a way that makes it easier to match the class.", 
    "So Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon came up with this term,", 
    "the two pizza team.", 
    "And as [INAUDIBLE] talked about, just because the calories per year go up", 
    "per Americans doesn't mean the teams are getting smaller.", 
    "It meant like, say four to nine people would get together, and that's an", 
    "effective size.", 
    "Now, how do you organize that team?", 
    "There's been a terminology, came up a few years ago called scrum, which", 
    "comes from rugby.", 
    "And the idea is every day at the same time, the two pizza team gets", 
    "together, and you go around in a circle, and you ask each other", 
    "questions to see where you are.", 
    "And if you want to learn more about that, that book does it.", 
    "But it's not, these ideas are pretty-- that's the other", 
    "thing about team stuff.", 
    "It's pretty straightforward.", 
    "You answer these three questions.", 
    "What have you done since yesterday?", 
    "What are you planning to do today?", 
    "And are there any impediments?", 
    "And the idea is as you go around in a group, you can figure out, well, if", 
    "you just did that in different orders, I wouldn't be blocked.", 
    "And you can talk that over.", 
    "And it's a short stand up meeting to do that.", 
    "So that's a big part of the scrum ideas.", 
    "And we [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "you be able to do that.", 
    "The other question is what's the roles?", 
    "There's the team.", 
    "OK, that's one role.", 
    "Then there's something called the ScrumMaster.", 
    "That's somebody who is the team member who acts as the buffer between the", 
    "team and all the external people.", 
    "People want to have meetings with you, the ScrumMaster handles that.", 
    "Make sure the team's working on the stories you're supposed", 
    "to be working on.", 
    "If you have rules about how you're supposed to do things, ScrumMaster", 
    "enforces that, and anything that's in the way.", 
    "Gee, the computers are too slow.", 
    "OK, that's my job to be able to take care of it.", 
    "The final role is what's called the product owner.", 
    "And that's the person who acts as the advocate for the customer.", 
    "And that's the person who prioritizes the user stories.", 
    "You're pretending to be the customer on that.", 
    "So basically, scrum is a self organizing small team.", 
    "Daily meetings.", 
    "They work in what's called sprints, like in rugby, as opposed to the", 
    "iterations of Agile.", 
    "So it may be two weeks or four weeks.", 
    "So everybody's all ready to go and works hard for two to four weeks.", 
    "And then they stop and see where they are.", 
    "And the members rotate through that role.", 
    "And scrum, I played rugby.", 
    "When there's a violation, you get together, this big mass of people push", 
    "at each other, and that's where he's supposed to come from.", 
    "So with that, questions about what's true about scrum?", 
    "I'll do a quick question.", 
    "Scrum is at its best when it's difficult to plan ahead.", 
    "Scrum is as good for safety critical software as well", 
    "software as a service.", 
    "Scrum implies Agile development.", 
    "All of them are true."
