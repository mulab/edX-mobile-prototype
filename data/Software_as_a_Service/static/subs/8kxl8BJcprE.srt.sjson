    "SOLOM HEDDAYA: That is this issue of service versus product business model.", 
    "In many cases, you really have an option.", 
    "In some cases, you have no option.", 
    "But I faced this question in my company when we were starting.", 
    "We started and Akamai started about six months after us.", 
    "Those of you who don't know Akamai, Akamai is the major CDN, content", 
    "delivery network, in the world today.", 
    "Most content that is not from Google--", 
    "most content is served from Akamai, that is on the web.", 
    "So they started six months after us.", 
    "And they were working in the same area exactly.", 
    "They chose to be an online service, and we chose, in my", 
    "company, to be a product.", 
    "We were actually making that decision very intentionally.", 
    "And the reason for choosing to be a product company was because we wanted", 
    "good work-life balance.", 
    "We actually thought of it explicitly in those terms.", 
    "And that was 1997.", 
    "Because the service has to be on 24 by seven, 365, all the time.", 
    "The idea of being woken up at two in the morning to fix something, because", 
    "otherwise the business was going down the drain, was not appealing.", 
    "However, we made the wrong decision.", 
    "For--", 
    "exactly.", 
    "To hell with work-life balance.", 
    "And, of course, we watched as Akamai found it easy to sell the service.", 
    "Because you can just go to someone and say, hey, you already pay for", 
    "bandwidth, look, if you pay me some of that, I'll deliver you video, and it", 
    "will be oh so much better.", 
    "Any questions?", 
    "The service is much more easy to sell.", 
    "Much easier, much faster.", 
    "That's something that people on the technology side don't quite", 
    "appreciate, and I didn't appreciate it until I went out on--", 
    "as CTO of the company--", 
    "I went out on sales calls to big ISPs.", 
    "Our customers were the backbone ISP.", 
    "And I could see that they--", 
    "oh, OK, I have to buy this complex technology, I have to figure out how", 
    "to install it, how to run it, and what if you guys vanish,", 
    "and all these questions.", 
    "I don't have a budget lined item for caches.", 
    "I buy switches, I buy routers.", 
    "What is a cache?", 
    "It was called InfoLibria.", 
    "At peak we were considered the best in delivering broadband video, high", 
    "definition video, and rich web apps.", 
    "But our customers--", 
    "Netflix didn't exist at the time, and neither did Amazon Video Demand and so", 
    "there was very little understanding.", 
    "But still, the key point is service is much, much easier to sell.", 
    "Because the customer can see it, obviously, and they", 
    "can come in and out.", 
    "But here's the key point for Cosmos, is number 4, which is that the", 
    "vendor-customer relationship is both stronger and much, much faster.", 
    "In fact, the data that goes into Cosmos is this data.", 
    "The feedback loop, the feedback delay, is practically instantaneous.", 
    "Whereas, if you sell a product--", 
    "you sell say, the iPhone, how long does it take for", 
    "customers to give you feedback?", 
    "You spend a few years developing the thing and once you release it then you", 
    "start giving feedback at that point in time.", 
    "If the antenna is broken, has a big bug, what is there for you to do?", 
    "You have to wait for the next revision.", 
    "So the feedback is over years.", 
    "Whereas, for an online service, the feedback could be minutes.", 
    "That's one.", 
    "The second, of course, is the amount of feedback.", 
    "So I started to see that in Windows because Windows was already moving to", 
    "become more like an online service in the sense that we keep track of our", 
    "customers in real time.", 
    "But still, not as much as being Google Search or any of", 
    "the real online services.", 
    "So this feedback loop, the speed of that feedback loop is the key reason", 
    "for a need for agility.", 
    "And the same goes for our system as well.", 
    "We are both the repository for this interaction data, and we are an online", 
    "service, and we have feedback.", 
    "I'll just note that it's not all upside.", 
    "There are significant downsides.", 
    "Well, their ability to control it is lower because they put--", 
    "imagine a financial business, a bank.", 
    "Their asset is really their data.", 
    "That's really what they do.", 
    "So if they store the data under lock and key just like they store the", 
    "money, and they have the lock and they have the key, then they might feel", 
    "better about it.", 
    "When they store the data on Microsoft premises, which is what they're", 
    "starting to do, or Google or wherever.", 
    "Amazon, more likely.", 
    "Then there is a question.", 
    "Who else has access?", 
    "Who might have access to the data?", 
    "How can I control it?", 
    "So security is really a huge issue for all of the online services.", 
    "Not just the privacy, and not in the individual privacy, which is obvious", 
    "to everyone, but in the enterprise privacy.", 
    "One thing that affects our design and causes agile to be also a little bit", 
    "of a stress is really something has to do with the way we architect systems.", 
    "So when you are building the software for a service, you", 
    "are your own customer.", 
    "This is kind of strange, right?", 
    "Why is this strange?", 
    "It means that you're writing software but you have exactly one customer for", 
    "that software.", 
    "Who takes delivery of that software and installs it and runs it?", 
    "One.", 
    "It's you, actually.", 
    "You are your own customer.", 
    "That's pretty, actually, bad for architecture.", 
    "Because it means that I write the software, I check it in, I release it,", 
    "and I send it to my customer-- which is me--", 
    "I take that software, install it and run it.", 
    "Configure it, tune it and run it.", 
    "That's then how I deliver the service.", 
    "But that means I can cut corners in the following particular ways.", 
    "I can not pay too much attention to interface design.", 
    "Why?", 
    "Because my customer is very friendly to me, and very forgiving, and doesn't", 
    "really care too much about the interfaces being great.", 
    "Because that customer writes code against those interfaces to run the", 
    "service and that's me.", 
    "Only the most external--", 
    "only the service interface is important.", 
    "All the internal interfaces start to lose this social pressure to make them", 
    "nice and clean.", 
    "That actually is a very insidious force.", 
    "Very insidious.", 
    "It means that it's very hard to convince developers to write, to", 
    "design clean interface.", 
    "Very different.", 
    "And that's something that, if you kind of walk around the halls and poke your", 
    "head and mention the word-- just the word--", 
    "clean interfaces to anyone and they will explode right away.", 
    "Because everyone has a pet peeve about how everyone else's", 
    "interfaces are not clean.", 
    "OK, so I make Bezos--", 
    "when I joined the team the team hadn't read Bezos' 2003 manifesto, really.", 
    "The famous memo.", 
    "And I made it required reading.", 
    "Precisely because I saw that it directly addresses this problem.", 
    "So, yes, absolutely, it has all sorts of advantages beyond what I just said.", 
    "So what Bezos said was--", 
    "you guys are familiar with it, I'm sure-- which is that every component", 
    "has to pretend as if it's a free-standing online service.", 
    "This has lots of goodness with it, but it has some downsides.", 
    "The goodness is not just the clean interfaces, it's something else.", 
    "It's that the liveness of the service is also owned by the people.", 
    "So in a system as complex as Cosmos, we have a problem which is that when", 
    "there is a life-size problem like the dreaded two AM call that wakes you up,", 
    "the question is, who else is supposed to wake up in order to", 
    "mitigate the problem?", 
    "Who else?", 
    "This is a simple question.", 
    "With service oriented architecture with as many components as possible", 
    "being free-standing, you know exactly who you can call.", 
    "Also, you know which boundaries you have to be defensive against.", 
    "And so you reduce the number of people you have to wake up as well.", 
    "That is really important because this is about the social aspects of the", 
    "service model and this work-life balance thing.", 
    "The fewer the number of people you have to wake up, the better.", 
    "That's fantastic.", 
    "There is one downside which they're suffering from today, and", 
    "that is that you--", 
    "discourage commonality.", 
    "Discourage sharing of tools, and sharing--", 
    "because the only vehicle of sharing is on a service-oriented interface.", 
    "And so if you will not publish too many of these, because they have to", 
    "put SLAs on them, because of quality of uptime and availability of", 
    "performance, so they don't publish as many.", 
    "And so the reuse of code and pooling is much less than you would", 
    "find even at Google.", 
    "So there is a real question of how to get the best of both worlds.", 
    "I don't know that there is a definitive answer, but I feel like we", 
    "need to go--", 
    "at Microsoft-- we need to go farther in that direction."
