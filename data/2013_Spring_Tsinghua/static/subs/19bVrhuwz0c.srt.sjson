    "DAN KLEIN: OK.", 
    "So what about all that other stuff, right?", 
    "I talked about--", 
    "this is all very heavy on perception, on actuation,", 
    "robotics, mobile platforms, real kind of live data", 
    "interacting with humans.", 
    "What about that other classic AI stuff?", 
    "We talked about theorem proving.", 
    "Can we prove mathematical theorems?", 
    "That stuff is happening too, and it's also important.", 
    "So on the logic front, for example, we can build amazing", 
    "theorem provers, compared to when people", 
    "started doing this.", 
    "These provers are used for more than", 
    "just proving theorems.", 
    "For example, NASA used these for fault diagnosis.", 
    "There are some question answering systems which are no", 
    "longer purely logical, but there is a component of", 
    "logical theorem proving.", 
    "You try to prove that the statement that you think", 
    "answers the question actually entails the question in the", 
    "appropriate way.", 
    "That's a way that logic and theorem proving has made its", 
    "way into very different domains, like natural language", 
    "processing.", 
    "The methods people use are things like deduction systems.", 
    "The closest we'll get to this in this class is constraint", 
    "satisfaction, but you'll get a flavor for", 
    "how this stuff works.", 
    "Also, it's worth pointing out that satisfyability solvers", 
    "have had huge advances in the past decade, and are now able", 
    "to do really amazing things.", 
    "What's shown here on the right is a proof of something called", 
    "the Robbins conjecture, and you probably haven't heard the", 
    "Robbins conjecture itself, but it was an open algebraic", 
    "question, and there was a short human interpretable", 
    "proof that a theorem prover chugged out that humans have", 
    "been looking for for awhile.", 
    "This is a case of you see it, and you're like, oh, yeah,", 
    "that's right.", 
    "That's a case of an open question being proved by a", 
    "computer, in the way humans will prove it, in the sense", 
    "that a human can interpret the proof.", 
    "There's also theorem proving by computers, where the", 
    "computer does a brute force, where the human doesn't want", 
    "to check 4.7 billion cases, but the computer does, and so", 
    "the computer does it.", 
    "So what else?", 
    "Game playing.", 
    "There's been a lot of advances in game playing.", 
    "I'm going to tell you about the classic thing, because I", 
    "think, actually, this is one of these pivotal points in AI", 
    "where we kind of really realize that maybe we had", 
    "capacities that we didn't before.", 
    "Before we could play checkers--", 
    "OK, today, checkers is solved.", 
    "We'll talk more about checkers when we talk about game", 
    "playing later.", 
    "But there was this classic moment in May of '97--", 
    "Deep Blue, which shown here--", 
    "Deep Blue looks approximately like a refrigerator--", 
    "is giant, parallel, special purpose hardware that", 
    "basically exists to crunch through chess positions, and", 
    "it beat the world champion, Kasparov, and the play, the", 
    "sequence of moves was described as intelligent and", 
    "creative, as opposed to kind of maybe alien and weird.", 
    "So you could imagine humans being like, \"Wow, yeah, I", 
    "guess those moves are legal, but weird, right?\" You could", 
    "imagine the kind of-- you play the chess, and all the pieces", 
    "scatter to the corner, and they all come back, and you've", 
    "lost, and you're like, \"What the heck just happened?\" But", 
    "no, it's just like, yeah, that's a good move.", 
    "That's better than the human.", 
    "And you can interpret it, right?", 
    "And that's amazing, because this thing's crunching 200", 
    "million board positions per second.", 
    "It was amazing then.", 
    "You can now do that with a PC cluster.", 
    "So things have advanced, obviously.", 
    "But the amazing thing is, it's doing nothing like what the", 
    "humans are doing when they play chess, but the resulting", 
    "behavior is surprisingly similar.", 
    "And this is a case of there are lots of different", 
    "computations you can do, but there is good, kind of", 
    "rational behavior, and there are", 
    "multiple ways to get there.", 
    "We don't always know how humans get there, but we do", 
    "have ways of making machines do it in some way.", 
    "So there's this open question.", 
    "How do humans play chess?", 
    "There's lots of things you just can't do.", 
    "When you get into a multiplication race with the", 
    "computer, like here's some five digit numbers, go--", 
    "you know you're going to lose.", 
    "There are just things that you know the computer is better.", 
    "Why isn't the computer actually just so much better", 
    "at chess that we lost this battle in the '80s?", 
    "It's an open question how humans are so good.", 
    "I mean, they lose, but they try.", 
    "It's kind of amazing.", 
    "How can humans compute with computers at all?", 
    "In 1996, actually, Kasparov beat Deep Blue, and had some", 
    "really nice words to say.", 
    "Kasparov said, \"I could feel--", 
    "no, I could smell--", 
    "a new kind of intelligence across the table.\" I mean, I", 
    "don't really know what that means.", 
    "I don't know-- some new intelligent scent you could", 
    "hang in your car.", 
    "But Kasparov was very positive.", 
    "And then in 1997, Deep Blue hasn't proven anything.", 
    "So yeah, I guess that's more a comment about humans.", 
    "There have been huge advances in gameplay recently.", 
    "For example, in Go.", 
    "A couple years ago when I would talk about Go, I would", 
    "say Go is a case where humans are so much better than", 
    "machines that the human masters will not even play the", 
    "machines because it's insulting.", 
    "Now the machines are pretty good, and able to play", 
    "extremely competitive people and win.", 
    "And that's been very recent.", 
    "We'll talk about how some of those", 
    "advances work much later.", 
    "OK, so you just all kind of toured the areas of AI, and", 
    "we'll kind of go into these throughout the course in a", 
    "little more depth.", 
    "But really, AI is all around you in a way that doesn't", 
    "always categorize so neatly.", 
    "So in general, applied AI is automation of some kind.", 
    "There's some decision problem you want to automate, or", 
    "something that's too hard for you to do by hand, and you", 
    "want computer assistance.", 
    "So scheduling, airline routing, military planning,", 
    "things like that-- regularly done by AI.", 
    "Route planning-- every time you go get a", 
    "traffic map, that's AI.", 
    "The search algorithms aren't so different than the kinds of", 
    "things we'll do when we study search.", 
    "And medical diagnosis.", 
    "You can kind of input your symptoms.", 
    "There are medical diagnosis systems that will then try to", 
    "figure out the underlying diagnosis.", 
    "These systems, actually, in many cases, are very good.", 
    "There are even cases where they can", 
    "be better than humans.", 
    "Web search engines-- some of you may have used", 
    "a web search engine.", 
    "This has got AI everywhere.", 
    "It's got some natural language in the text.", 
    "There's machine learning and figuring out how to rank", 
    "results using multiple kinds of features.", 
    "It's kind of AI everywhere in these things.", 
    "Spam classifiers--", 
    "you may have noticed that the amount of spam you got your in", 
    "your life probably shot up while you were young, as kind", 
    "of people learned how to spam.", 
    "And then recently, I think it's been under much better", 
    "control, and that has to do with a lot better both machine", 
    "learning AI techniques for spam classification.", 
    "Automated help desks--", 
    "that's AI.", 
    "Fraud detection on your credit card, product recommendations", 
    "when you go to Amazon, all this stuff is AI.", 
    "So there are a lot of things that don't really boil down to", 
    "challenging a grandmaster at chess, but are equally", 
    "applicable to industry's problems today that come from", 
    "the techniques that you're going to learn", 
    "about in this course."
