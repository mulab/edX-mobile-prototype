    "to use debuggers even though you're sure your code is going to", 
    "be right this time.", 
    "And the acronym of RASP.", 
    "First, actually read those messages, then ask your friends with a detailed", 
    "question, and take advantage of search to see if someone's", 
    "got that error message.", 
    "And then, last case is very cool new technology of forums, which we use in", 
    "this class, and ask a good question and you get the answer back in a", 
    "surprising number of minutes.", 
    "A very natural thing to do when you start in Rails is to put too much code", 
    "in the Controller or actually putting any code at all in", 
    "the view, just about.", 
    "And the idea is to put it in the model so that you can reuse the Controller", 
    "and the Views with lots of different models.", 
    "This agile idea, a big theme in the course, is working with customers,", 
    "keeping a prototype that's working so that the work that you do is really", 
    "helpful, you don't have to throw a lot of work away, which is sadly the case", 
    "for lots of software projects.", 
    "One of the big ideas in the class that we're doing is", 
    "testing is really important.", 
    "And the idea of writing your test before you write the code.", 
    "And this part of it, the behavior driven design, is doing the design", 
    "before you write the code.", 
    "And the way we do that to work with-- how do you work with stakeholders who", 
    "don't really know what they want until they see it or well, when they see it,", 
    "they know don't want it.", 
    "We use these 3\" x 5\" cards, and it's easy to throw them away, easy to", 
    "reorganize, nonthreatening, works really well.", 
    "And then, like I said, the most amazing tool in this class in my", 
    "perspective is this Cucumber that goes all the way from something customers", 
    "can understand, 3\" x 5\" cards, into code that runs tests.", 
    "And it just makes that leap all the way across there.", 
    "And last time, I tried this idea of thoughts for the day, thoughts for the", 
    "end of the day, as the Reasonable Person Principle is assume people you", 
    "meet are reasonable, especially assume everybody on your team is reasonable,", 
    "and if they do something that you just can't imagine, ask questions and see", 
    "if they really are reasonable or not.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Today, what we're going to do is another tightwire rope where Dave", 
    "Patterson can successfully enhance RottenPotatoes.", 
    "Again, that's always exciting from my perspective.", 
    "The implicit versus explicit and imperative", 
    "versus declarative scenarios.", 
    "So you see different things about the scenarios get more sophisticated.", 
    "Bunch of fallacies and particularly, pitfalls in BDD and the pros and cons.", 
    "Then we're going to pick up things that were skipped over in the lectures", 
    "in the past to kind of get the order right.", 
    "Go back in HTML and cascading style sheets.", 
    "How you make things look cool and you'll see an amazing website that you", 
    "change the sheet and it looks dramatically different.", 
    "Template views and Haml, this concise version of HTML without all those", 
    "curly brackets and backslashes.", 
    "We'll talk about SaaS architecture.", 
    "If there's time, we'll talk about comments.", 
    "John Ousterhout view end comments, and see if there's time for another", 
    "thought of the day.", 
    "Enhancing RottenPotatoes.", 
    "Again, we've got our dancing Cucumber there.", 
    "We're going to make a cuke dance and the biggest rat in the world, the", 
    "Capybara, is going to help us.", 
    "Last time, what we did was-- to make it easy to get started, we documented", 
    "a feature that we already had.", 
    "This time what we're going to do is add something.", 
    "I guess, kind of naturally, if you have RottenPotatoes, there's this", 
    "other thing called the movie database, TMDb, which a lot of people use.", 
    "Rather than type all that stuff in, you're probably going to TMDb to get", 
    "that information.", 
    "Wouldn't it be great if you could, from the RottenPotatoes home page,", 
    "just search and find things on TMDb directly?", 
    "OK, like we said, this is a lot of SaaS applications, face users, and so", 
    "one of the things we need to do is, when you do a new feature, you need a", 
    "LoFi UI and then you need a storyboard to show how it's animated.", 
    "So this is the LoFi UI that I made to add the TMD thing.", 
    "The idea here is that what we want to do is work with the customer and when", 
    "it's really easy, at the cost of pencil and paper, agree that what's", 
    "supposed to happen at this level.", 
    "So here's the form I want, we'll have this \"add new movie\" button basically,", 
    "that you can click on.", 
    "Here's a form you fill it with the title and then when you hit search,", 
    "and if you find a match, it goes to this RottenPotatoes page, if TMD finds", 
    "it and you put this information there.", 
    "And if there's no match, sorry, we couldn't find it so maybe you", 
    "misspelled it or something and you try it again.", 
    "So pretty easy storyboard.", 
    "That's the feature we want to implement.", 
    "Now, that's the LoFi UI and storyboard, what does the", 
    "actual story look like?", 
    "What's the feature?", 
    "So the feature is, the user can add a movie by searching in TMDb.", 
    "So as a movie fan, so I can add new movies without manual tedium, I want", 
    "to add movies by looking up their details in TMDb rather than going to", 
    "the web or something.", 
    "Now, normally, what you would do is do they happy path.", 
    "There were two options there in that prior slide, right?", 
    "You found it and you didn't find it.", 
    "Normally, you would do the happy path, but to do the happy path we have to", 
    "write the method that does that does that searching and matching.", 
    "Because we have to do this in some order, Armando and I thought it best", 
    "to do it kind of top down.", 
    "We're going to explain behavior driven design, and next week, we'll explain", 
    "test-driven development, the code itself.", 
    "So what we need to do is-- and what you normally do is--", 
    "you go back and forth.", 
    "You do the BDD and then the TDD.", 
    "So you get the behavior you want and then you actually start implementing", 
    "that code for that feature, and that's the way you do it iteratively.", 
    "But we can't present both simultaneously.", 
    "So what I'm going to do instead of the happy path, I'm going", 
    "to do the sad path.", 
    "So where we don't have to go to the code and say--", 
    "It's really easy to write the method as we can't find it.", 
    "And the method I'm going to write is never going to find anything, we're", 
    "just going to do the sad path.", 
    "But that's not the right way to do it but that's the way it makes sense", 
    "pedagogical for the lectures.", 
    "So anyways, going back, you search for it and if you find it--", 
    "and the sad path I'm doing, so I'm going to say, when I fill in search", 
    "term for some movie that doesn't exist and I press search, I should be on the", 
    "RottenPotatoes home page and I'll get an error message in the flash, the", 
    "movie doesn't exist.", 
    "So that's the first test that I'm writing.", 
    "That's the user story in the feature.", 
    "OK, so there's some pieces I'll tell you about and then we'll do the demo.", 
    "One of things we're going to need to do is, we talked about a little bit", 
    "last time, and we'll talk more about it, is Haml, and that is this kind of", 
    "concise version set of writing HTML.", 
    "And this is the code that we're going to do.", 
    "The Haml is, on that first line, that's the search for the movie, and", 
    "we have to, on that form tag, the action is we have to come up with a", 
    "name for something we're searching and we're going to call that search TMDb,", 
    "you have to make up the name.", 
    "And then, the label at the end is what we're going to fill in the terms when", 
    "it does match.", 
    "And this code is at that Pastebin site.", 
    "So what does that Haml code turn into?", 
    "You see it's got these two equal signs, just two lines, it gets turned", 
    "into all of these labels, the backslash labels in text, and so", 
    "that's just the idea.", 
    "A lot of what happens in the Rails community is when they see something", 
    "that's kind of verbose, they try and invent something to make it more", 
    "concise and easier to write and easier to read.", 
    "So that's why we're using Haml in this class.", 
    "If we were to try that in Cucumber, what's going to happen?", 
    "We'll put that in and it's going to fail because it's missing the route,", 
    "and we're also going to have to add this method for the search TMDb, as I", 
    "said redundantly here: yeah, normally, we would implement it, instead we're", 
    "going to just do the sad path.", 
    "The missing route looks like this, where we just have to do a post to go", 
    "over to be able to find it.", 
    "And then this is the fake method that we're going to do.", 
    "You see that it always, all this method search TMDb, it", 
    "always fails, right?", 
    "You get it, it goes directly to the flash, it says, nope, couldn't find", 
    "it, and goes back to the movies_path.", 
    "OK, now, the exciting part.", 
    "We're going to start off with in RottenPotatoes, and let's just try", 
    "that Cucumber path before we do anything.", 
    "And we know that it's going to fail.", 
    "And we'll just see the lines roll by here before we start fixing it up, and", 
    "then we'll start adding things, following ideas in the book to start", 
    "hopefully getting it so all the steps will pass.", 
    "You see the top part of it--", 
    "Yep, and it did.", 
    "One passed, one failed, and the blue ones were skipped.", 
    "So you should be able to roll up and see it.", 
    "I expect it to be a content for the search TMDb for movie in", 
    "RottenPotatoes but it wasn't there.", 
    "And so let's go fix that.", 
    "So what we're going to do is go to Pastebin.", 
    "This is what we wanted to add in the index.html.haml, add this view.", 
    "So then we click this little button to copy it, if you didn't.", 
    "The problem is, when it's pretty printed like this sometimes, the", 
    "quotes and things are the wrong one but this--", 
    "copying it there will copy it from below where it's just plain text.", 
    "OK, it's add to the end of movies index.html.", 
    "OK, so I think that's this file.", 
    "And, oh yeah.", 
    "I need to : set paste, or bad things happen, all right.", 
    "And go up here.", 
    "Paste.", 
    "Yep, that looks good.", 
    "All right, saved it.", 
    "And run Cuke again.", 
    "OK, there we go.", 
    "I think it even says in here it couldn't find the route.", 
    "Thanks, I didn't save it.", 
    "All right, way at the top here.", 
    "All these messages.", 
    "That's a lot, OK.", 
    "No route matches, OK.", 
    "So let's go to--", 
    "This one I think is the route.", 
    "Yeah, routes.rb.", 
    "The book shows what the next thing that I want, so I'll add to routes.rb", 
    "just after resources where we post the route.", 
    "Copied it right after resources.", 
    "Once again, if you're going to use--", 
    "I've got to admit, I'm shocked that I'm still using VI", 
    "all these years later.", 
    "I know the inventor of VI.", 
    "I bet that he doesn't use VI.", 
    "I'm surprised it's still wired in my brain.", 
    "I remember the commands.", 
    "I thought they would have been long gone.", 
    "I guess for my own personal neuron perspective it's great that I remember", 
    "it, but I can't believe I'm using this kind of editor in 2012.", 
    "But Armando's very proud of his text editor.", 
    "He still thinks it's really great.", 
    "OK, that's the post and let's go ahead and put the dummy--", 
    "we're going to put the dummy controller method in there.", 
    "I just need to find it.", 
    "All right, here's our silly controller method that always fails", 
    "and sends the message.", 
    "And it says, add it anywhere.", 
    "OK, we'll get right at the top.", 
    "It's terrible, things happen when you don't--", 
    "Now, paste.", 
    "OK, that looks good.", 
    "Just save it again.", 
    "And the drum roll.", 
    "Will it pass?", 
    "So we did the user's story, we did the storyboard, we wrote it out in the", 
    "language of Cucumber with all the steps, and now, we linked it together.", 
    "And yes, it passed.", 
    "So now, we've implemented the sad path using the Cucumber.", 
    "We have a test, we could try again.", 
    "The idea of writing these tests first or describing the behavior is, over", 
    "time you're going to be evolving the code in the Agile model.", 
    "Every couple of weeks, you're going to add features, you're going to want to", 
    "go back and re-run these codes all the time, make sure you", 
    "didn't break anything.", 
    "So this will just make sure if you put something in that's not in TMDb, it's", 
    "going to work right.", 
    "OK, going back.", 
    "For the happy path, some of the steps are the same as the sad path.", 
    "A big theme of the course is, how do you get productivity and conciseness?", 
    "So, happily, the Cucumber has ways to try and make it DRY, right?", 
    "You repeat yourself.", 
    "If you see a lot of repetition of something, and there's this idea in", 
    "Cucumber called a background, they added that after the first feature,", 
    "that says, do all these steps first.", 
    "If we compare the background information here.", 
    "So here's an example.", 
    "Here's the sad path I just did or here's the two stories, user can try", 
    "and add the movie.", 
    "And here's the sad path, it starts here and goes to here, and here's the", 
    "happy path where it works.", 
    "Well, what we can do is put a lot of these things that are common to the", 
    "two scenarios in a background and that will automatically run first.", 
    "So real things have lots of stories.", 
    "You'd like to make ways to reduce what you do and background", 
    "is a way to do that.", 
    "OK, so this is summarizing what we've seen.", 
    "So you get this new feature, you do the UI for it, you write the step", 
    "definitions, and typically, you write new methods before", 
    "Cucumber can do a green.", 
    "And usually you write it first.", 
    "The background let's us DRY out that code so that we can share the steps.", 
    "We don't have to do it.", 
    "And we're testing the behavior with BDD and Cucumber.", 
    "And TDD and RSpec is what's going to happen next.", 
    "OK now we're ready with that to try some of these up here instructions.", 
    "OK, which statements are true?", 
    "Implement all code being tested before Cucumber will say", 
    "that the test passes?", 
    "You have to implement all the code.", 
    "A sad path can pass without having the code written to make", 
    "the happy path pass.", 
    "OK, this may not be the hardest question I asked this semester.", 
    "OK, ready, set, vote."
