    "DAN KLEIN: So how did we get where we are today?", 
    "So here's a kind of short history of AI.", 
    "Really, to put it in as simple as possible terms, AI looked", 
    "like this: We had people who wanted to build these things", 
    "and they had dreams.", 
    "They had dreams of these amazing robots, and the", 
    "robots, they thought, they talked.", 
    "They did whatever we wanted the robots to do, translate,", 
    "play chess, whatever.", 
    "And then they started to build.", 
    "And really, at the beginning, it was like kids with", 
    "Tinkertoys, really.", 
    "The tools we had available were not adequate to realize", 
    "our vision.", 
    "And in a lot of ways, they still aren't.", 
    "And so we had this grand dream, but very kind of", 
    "limited in practice.", 
    "And that really is the short story of AI.", 
    "I'm now going to show you a documentary fragment.", 
    "So now we'll get the thinking machines.", 
    "Let me tell you what we're going to see for a second.", 
    "This is an excerpt from an old program called Nova.", 
    "And this consists of a discussion, from a modern", 
    "perspective, of what AI was like in the early", 
    "days, say, the '50s.", 
    "And it's going to have interviews, conducted a long", 
    "time ago, with a bunch of people, some of whose names", 
    "you will recognize, who were amazingly smart people,", 
    "predicting on the basis of the first two years of computation", 
    "where AI was going to go.", 
    "And now we can look back, 50 plus years later, and kind of", 
    "think through what that meant and where we are today.", 
    "So let's take a look.", 
    "[VIDEO PLAYBACK]", 
    "-The thinking machine.", 
    "-Hello, again.", 
    "With me tonight is Professor Jerome B. Wiesner, director of", 
    "the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT.", 
    "Dr. Wiesner, what really worries me today is what's", 
    "going to happen to us if machines can think.", 
    "And what interests me specifically is, can they?", 
    "-Well, that's a very hard question to answer.", 
    "If you had asked me that question just a few years ago,", 
    "I'd have said it was very far-fetched.", 
    "But today I just have to admit, I don't really know.", 
    "I suspect if you come back in four or five years, I'll say,", 
    "\"Sure, they really do think.\"", 
    "-Well, if you're confused, Doctor, how", 
    "do you think I feel?", 
    "-We're just really beginning to understand the capabilities", 
    "of the computer.", 
    "I've got some film to illustrate this point, which I", 
    "think will amaze you.", 
    "-That man isn't playing checkers against a", 
    "computer, is he?", 
    "-Sure, and it plays pretty well.", 
    "-While most computer scientists saw it as a mere", 
    "number cruncher, a small group thought that the digital", 
    "computer had a much grander destiny.", 
    "Being a general purpose machine, it could be", 
    "programmed to do things which, in humans, require", 
    "intelligence: play games like checkers and chess and solve", 
    "brain teasers.", 
    "-Let's see what it's printing out.", 
    "-The field became known as artificial intelligence.", 
    "-Can machines really think?", 
    "Even the scientists argue that one.", 
    "-I'm convinced that machines can and will think.", 
    "I don't mean the machines will behave like men.", 
    "I don't think for a very long time we're going to have a", 
    "difficult problem distinguishing", 
    "a man from a robot.", 
    "And I don't think my daughter will ever marry a computer.", 
    "But I think that computers will be doing the things that", 
    "men do when we say they're thinking.", 
    "I'm convinced that machines can and will", 
    "think in our lifetime.", 
    "-I confidently expect that within a matter of 10 or 15", 
    "years, something will emerge from a laboratory which is not", 
    "too far from a robot of science fiction fame.", 
    "-They hadn't reckoned with ambiguity when they set out to", 
    "use computers to translate languages.", 
    "-A $500,000 super calculator, the most versatile electronic", 
    "brain known, translates Russian into English.", 
    "Instead of mathematical wizardry, a sentence in", 
    "Russian is to be fed--", 
    "-One of the first non-numerical applications of", 
    "computers, it was hyped as the solution to the Cold War", 
    "obsession of keeping tabs on what the Russians were doing.", 
    "Claims were made that the computer would replace most", 
    "human translators.", 
    "-At present, of course, you're just in the", 
    "experimental stage.", 
    "When you go in for full-scale production, what will the", 
    "capacity be?", 
    "-We should be able to do, with a modern commercial computer,", 
    "about 1 to 2 million words an hour.", 
    "And this will be quite an adequate speed to cope with", 
    "the holdout of the Soviet Union in just a few hours", 
    "computer time a week.", 
    "-When do you hope to be able to achieve this speed?", 
    "-If our experiments go well, then perhaps within five years", 
    "or so.", 
    "-And finally, Mr. McDaniel, does this mean the end of", 
    "human translators?", 
    "-I'd say yes for translators of scientific", 
    "and technical material.", 
    "But as regards to poetry and novels, no, I don't think", 
    "we'll ever replace the translators of", 
    "that type of material.", 
    "-Mr. McDaniel, thank you very much.", 
    "[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]", 
    "SPEAKER: OK, so that was the '50s and '60s.", 
    "That was the early days.", 
    "In the '50s, people basically realized that you could do", 
    "computation with circuits, and the brain was kind of a little", 
    "bit like a bunch of circuits, so surely", 
    "we were almost there.", 
    "And people got really excited.", 
    "And this is basically what you saw in this video.", 
    "They got the computer to play checkers reasonably well.", 
    "They got the computer to translate, or", 
    "at least come close.", 
    "What did that mean?", 
    "It meant you looked up the words in the dictionary and", 
    "you outputted them.", 
    "Turns out that actually there's a little bit more to", 
    "translation than that.", 
    "And so it was not the case that in five years they could", 
    "cope with the output of the entire Soviet Union in a", 
    "couple hours, right?", 
    "But think about where they were.", 
    "They talked about this $500,000 supercomputer.", 
    "In today's money, that's like $1 billion.", 
    "Really big expense computer, it has less computation than", 
    "your phone by orders of magnitude.", 
    "It probably has less computation than your toaster.", 
    "It may have less computation then your shoe, right?", 
    "And this thing, it could barely", 
    "kind of output a string.", 
    "And they're like, oh, next stop, intelligence.", 
    "And it looked so close.", 
    "And it just wasn't.", 
    "And when you go around saying that in four or five years we", 
    "will have it solved, and then nothing happens for 10 years", 
    "or 20 years, people started trying to write down", 
    "everything they knew because they realized", 
    "knowledge was important.", 
    "You couldn't act in the world without knowing something", 
    "about the world.", 
    "So they started writing everything down, like when ice", 
    "gets warm it melts.", 
    "And it turns out there's just an infinite number of these", 
    "facts and they contradict each other if you don't write them", 
    "down right.", 
    "And it turned out that this basically imploded.", 
    "So this whole industry that had all this excitement behind", 
    "it, there was this decision that actually, you know what,", 
    "it doesn't work.", 
    "It didn't work in four years.", 
    "It didn't work in 40 years.", 
    "It's just a bust.", 
    "And it's what people call AI winter.", 
    "People totally lost confidence in the whole endeavor.", 
    "The AI classes were not filled like this.", 
    "And there was not an industry presence of any of these", 
    "technologies.", 
    "People gave up on it as a pipe dream.", 
    "Then what happened?", 
    "In the '90s, people had a kind of change of heart.", 
    "Rather than using kind of the core tools of logic, which are", 
    "still important, they started using the core tools of", 
    "probability and statistics.", 
    "They had a focus on uncertainty, which turned out", 
    "to be the key thing you needed to manage.", 
    "Whatever system you build, it wasn't going to perfect and it", 
    "wasn't going to know everything.", 
    "And you need to be able to balance all that stuff, the",
