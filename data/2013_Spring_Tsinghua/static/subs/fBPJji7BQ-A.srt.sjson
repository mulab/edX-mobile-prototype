    "There's Don't Repeat Yourself.", 
    "This is Hunt and Thomas wrote just around the same time as", 
    "agile development.", 
    "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous,", 
    "authoritative representation of the system.", 
    "And what they call DRY is Don't Repeat Yourself.", 
    "You don't want to find this in lots of places and why.", 
    "You want to have one place so that if you change it it", 
    "changes everywhere.", 
    "So, obviously nobody would copy and paste code.", 
    "A high level language does all kinds of things.", 
    "It does synthesis.", 
    "It generates code.", 
    "But probably the main thing is that it raises the level of", 
    "abstraction rather than that it does help with reuse", 
    "[INAUDIBLE].", 
    "Hold on.", 
    "And unfortunately that's my wife.", 
    "She doesn't realize I'm still teaching.", 
    "I'm working late.", 
    "And so you refactor your code but keep it dry.", 
    "And you'll hear us talk about dry code a lot.", 
    "Next up, software as a service.", 
    "This is one of the big reasons that Armando", 
    "and I did the course.", 
    "The research project that we were involved in was in cloud", 
    "computing software as a service.", 
    "That rather than having your own washing machine you get", 
    "could just rent it when you need it.", 
    "So, traditional software, shrink-wrap software, is this", 
    "binary code that is installed and runs wholly", 
    "in the client device.", 
    "What does software as a service mean?", 
    "To deliver the software and data as a service over the", 
    "internet via a thin program, typically the browser running", 
    "on a client device.", 
    "The cellphone that I just tried to answer, that's", 
    "typically the client today.", 
    "The so-called post PC era.", 
    "You have the mobile device and the cloud that things are in.", 
    "And examples are search, social networking, YouTube", 
    "videos, are examples of that.", 
    "Now, software as a service is such a powerful force that", 
    "shrink-wrapped software has to have versions now that are", 
    "SaaS versions of it.", 
    "So Microsoft Office, the productivity tools like Word,", 
    "PowerPoint, Excel and so forth, there's a Microsoft", 
    "Office 365, every day of the year.", 
    "That means you can use that without", 
    "having it on your computer.", 
    "Similarly, TurboTax.", 
    "If you guys haven't started paying taxes yet, TurboTax is", 
    "a very popular program.", 
    "Rather than everybody having to buy the software and", 
    "install it themselves you just go online and use the service.", 
    "So, Armando and I think that this on of the, a", 
    "revolutionary thing that's happening.", 
    "In this decade, software is increasingly going from", 
    "shrink-wrap software to software as a service.", 
    "And the companies who are going to be leading the", 
    "industry may be very different at the end of the decade than", 
    "at the beginning of it.", 
    "Why is it so popular?", 
    "Why do people like SaaS?", 
    "Well, from the user perspective you don't have to", 
    "worry whether you've got the right hardware or the right", 
    "version of the operating system,", 
    "especially with the browser.", 
    "It's pretty easy to install.", 
    "You don't have to worry about data loss.", 
    "The data is in the cloud.", 
    "Am I backing up my laptop?", 
    "Oops, I forgot to do that.", 
    "It's OK, it's in the cloud.", 
    "I lost my cell phone.", 
    "That's OK.", 
    "The data is in the cloud.", 
    "If you're sharing a lot of data it makes more sense for", 
    "that all to be in the cloud.", 
    "Then everybody's got their own version of it", 
    "running in their laptop.", 
    "The cloud's a natural place to do it .", 
    "So SaaS is a good software for that.", 
    "If the data is gigantic, or changes all the time, it would", 
    "be a hassle for you to keep a copy yourself.", 
    "So just keep it one central place.", 
    "That's another reason.", 
    "From the developer's", 
    "perspective, it's really wonderful.", 
    "There's only one copy of the software in the whole world.", 
    "And you get to pick the hardware and operating system", 
    "environment it runs in.", 
    "You get to control that.", 
    "So, there's no compatibility hassles for developers.", 
    "Now, on the other hand, the client piece of it, and", 
    "dealing with browsers, there's a lot of variety in browsers,", 
    "there's a hassle with that.", 
    "But the server piece is no hassle.", 
    "As a result of that, because there's only one copy of", 
    "software in a controlled hardware environment, SaaS", 
    "software changes a lot more quickly.", 
    "And so it makes it easier for developers to upgrade it.", 
    "But also it makes it easier for users.", 
    "It seems to me, every time I turn my computer some piece of", 
    "software is asking if it's OK to upgrade it.", 
    "I can't get any work done because I'm continuously", 
    "upgrading software that needs to be--", 
    "it seems like Adobe's business model is 7.0.3.4.", 
    "You want 7.0.3.5.", 
    "Don't bother me.", 
    "So with SaaS you don't get any of that stuff.", 
    "The excitement about software evolving in a way that makes", 
    "it easier teach is agile, fits right in there.", 
    "Frequent upgrades.", 
    "It's easy to do because there's only one environment.", 
    "That's the Agile lifecycle.", 
    "Every two weeks you can add new features.", 
    "And for those of you who don't think real software service", 
    "companies do that, it used to be--", 
    "the leading search engine used to be AltaVista.", 
    "Google came along with lots more frequent upgrades and", 
    "replaced that.", 
    "The leading social networking service used to be Myspace,", 
    "before Facebook.", 
    "So they really do compete on features.", 
    "And those who don't keep up fall behind.", 
    "Agile and SaaS is very popular.", 
    "The book lists half a dozen.", 
    "I'm sure there's dozens of environments.", 
    "But we've picked Ruby on Rails, which gets called", 
    "Rails, because we think it's by far the best environment.", 
    "It's the most productive environment.", 
    "You'll get more work done more quickly in that environment.", 
    "Ruby is, which we'll see beginning next week, is this", 
    "modern programming language.", 
    "It has object oriented, functional, automatic memory", 
    "management, dynamic types, this reuse via mix-ins, and", 
    "synthesis via metaprogramming.", 
    "It's got all that in there.", 
    "And that's why the inventor of Rails picked it.", 
    "He wanted to pick a good language.", 
    "Ruby, at the time he picked it, was an artistic success", 
    "but didn't have much following.", 
    "He built Rails in Ruby and that's helped both Rails and", 
    "[INAUDIBLE].", 
    "In this quick development model, Twitter in its first", 
    "many years was all done in Ruby.", 
    "Pieces that have been replaced.", 
    "So, a question that we get for teaching this class, and kind", 
    "of a concern for us, was why--", 
    "if we're learning software as a service-- why do we have to", 
    "learn Ruby in Rails?", 
    "And so, in thinking about it from our", 
    "perspective, you got 10 weeks.", 
    "And this is what you got learn here.", 
    "SaaS, Agile, Pair Programming.", 
    "We did all that stuff and then they said you've got to talk", 
    "about Legacy-- oh my God.", 
    "So we've got all these things that you really do need to", 
    "learn in 10 weeks.", 
    "And not only you guys, who are largely juniors and seniors,", 
    "this isn't the only class you're taking, right?", 
    "Say it's 50 weeks over a 14 week semester, you've got like", 
    "three weeks full time to work on this.", 
    "Well, what about the people in the MOOC?", 
    "They're not taking all these classes.", 
    "Almost everybody in the MOOC has a full time job.", 
    "So we had to figure out a way that in three weeks full time", 
    "you could learn all these big ideas.", 
    "And the only way we can imagine doing that is a really", 
    "highly productive framework.", 
    "So we think it's worth it to take the time to learn this", 
    "new language and learn this new system because you can use", 
    "it for the rest of the 10 weeks.", 
    "And you're going to get the payback for the investment.", 
    "And we wrote this all up in a paper.", 
    "So why are we doing that?", 
    "If I want to do SaaS and Agile, why do I", 
    "have to learn this?", 
    "Because first of all, we think if you want to become a", 
    "software engineer, learning new tools and languages", 
    "shouldn't be this scary idea.", 
    "Oh, yeah, I can know how to do that.", 
    "And we think it'll save you time in this class", 
    "for you to do that.", 
    "Next and last one of these.", 
    "So Google has all of these software as a services, which", 
    "is the weakest argument for the apps popularity?", 
    "I gave you these six reasons.", 
    "For Gmail, don't lose--", 
    "this is your judgment--", 
    "don't lose data is for Gmail.", 
    "What do you think about that versus cooperating groups and", 
    "their documents.", 
    "Large changing data sets and YouTube.", 
    "No field upgrade when improve a service in search.", 
    "So which of these is the weakest argument there for", 
    "doing these things as software as a service?", 
    "This one is surely a subject of opinion here."
