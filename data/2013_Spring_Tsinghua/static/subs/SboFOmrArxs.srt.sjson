    "DAVID PATTERSON: The purpose of the Lo-FI approach is to debug the UI", 
    "before you program it.",

    "Yeah, that's clearly true.", 
    "A BDD downside is requiring continuous contact with customers, which may not", 
    "be possible.", 
    "I'll talk about the downsides next-- this has made the question a little", 
    "bit harder, but this can happen.", 
    "You're excited about it.", 
    "You want the customer to be excited about it.", 
    "We hope we've found customers for you who are excited, but either they may", 
    "get busy or maybe their way of letting you know they're not so happy with", 
    "what's going on is they won't maintain contact.", 
    "But that can happen.", 
    "But that's a downside of the model, you're requiring the contact.", 
    "And if you can't get the customer to work with you, then what do you do.", 
    "So you may need to talk to somebody else somebody who make do.", 
    "It can lead to a poorer architecture since the focus is on behavior.", 
    "Not only is this a possibility, according to Beck--", 
    "who is one of the guys who nailed the agile manifesto on the door of the", 
    "church of big design, Jim Beck--", 
    "he says, it's likely to happen.", 
    "So you're likely end up with a poor software architecture since you're", 
    "doing this focus.", 
    "We will talk later about refactoring.", 
    "And you'll hear about design patterns.", 
    "So probably, this will happen.", 
    "And your job is to fix that.", 
    "Is to give it a good software architecture so you have [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "So it can happen initially, but you have to not just stick with what", 
    "you've got to go ahead.", 
    "OK, so now that you've answered that, let me go over the pros.", 
    "User stories, common language for stakeholders, nontechnical,", 
    "unintimidating way to interact with them, the fun way to interact with", 
    "them, that's great.", 
    "Writing the test before coding, believe it or not, you're going to", 
    "grow to believe that that's the only way to do it.", 
    "And it's a lot better than debugging is to spend time testing.", 
    "The continuous contact and the bad architecture.", 
    "And I said, we'll do the refactoring.", 
    "So this is a sign-- how many people have seen this sign?", 
    "All right.", 
    "If you were to intern at Google and you were to walk in the restroom, you", 
    "would see this sign.", 
    "Debugging sucks, testing rocks.", 
    "It doesn't feel natural at first.", 
    "And, in fact, I think that's what I would say about software engineering", 
    "in general.", 
    "Why is there software engineering?", 
    "Because the things that programmers naturally do, doesn't work.", 
    "If it was natural, we wouldn't even talk about software engineering.", 
    "You're an optimist.", 
    "You just think, well, I'll just go in and write the code and I'll do the", 
    "testing later.", 
    "We've tried that.", 
    "Computer science is 50 or 60 years old, we've tried that.", 
    "Alas, it doesn't work.", 
    "So what Armando says, who writes a little bit more code than I do, is", 
    "once you've learned this BDD stuff that you get the behavior, and you", 
    "write tests.", 
    "And you don't get the weeks of frustrating bugs, you can't turn back.", 
    "You say, I'm never going to do it that way again.", 
    "And we surveyed the people who graduated from this class.", 
    "And 2/3 of them said the BDD/TDD stuff is very useful in the industry.", 
    "Helped them get jobs and things like that.", 
    "So it's not natural, but suspend your disbelief.", 
    "Try it for one whole semester, for one class, and see what you think.", 
    "And we believe you'll get hooked.", 
    "We're going to go back and pick up some things that we skipped over.", 
    "HTML and CSS.", 
    "So where are we?", 
    "This is this 100,000 foot level, Armando covered these.", 
    "He skipped the HTML and CSS.", 
    "He quickly went over that.", 
    "But that's what we're going to talk about today.", 
    "And this is what HTML and CSS does is tell the browser what", 
    "it's looking for.", 
    "So HTML is a markup language.", 
    "And a markup language takes something that looks like that, you mark it up", 
    "with these things in red, and these are all plain ASCII, and you see it's", 
    "got these open and close tags with the slash symbols there.", 
    "OK that's the markup language.", 
    "And after you put the markup language, it looks like this.", 
    "And that's your training.", 
    "That's the end of it.", 
    "Actually there's a little more than that, but that's basically the idea.", 
    "Interestingly, where did this come from?", 
    "It's actually IBM.", 
    "You wouldn't think of IBM as a big web company in the old days.", 
    "But they actually had all these competing divisions.", 
    "They did a lot of documentation.", 
    "They came up with something called the Generalized Markup Language 50 years", 
    "ago to deal with the different companies.", 
    "And it had this kind of style.", 
    "There's a document.", 
    "This hierarchical collection of elements.", 
    "You can have this nesting.", 
    "You can embed different things in them.", 
    "There's forms which allow people to fill things in.", 
    "And that allowed them have attributes to mark parts of this marked up code.", 
    "So that came from IBM.", 
    "And in particular, these attributes, we'll talk a lot about ID and class", 
    "attributes, which we'll use for styling with CSS.", 
    "Let's talk about these CSS, cascading style sheets.", 
    "The big idea here is to separate the style from the information.", 
    "That's the big idea.", 
    "There's a bunch of reasons to do it.", 
    "One that people don't think about is accessibility.", 
    "So if people have vision problems or they just want different looks, you", 
    "can have the information--", 
    "and I'll show you these stunning examples, where you just change the", 
    "style sheet and it looks completely different.", 
    "A lot of you have probably seen that little demo from", 
    "Google on Google Glass.", 
    "That's kind of new interface of the future.", 
    "Your computer will have your glasses and you'll have augmented reality.", 
    "So that's going to have a user interface that'll be voice based.", 
    "And CSS will allow you to have a voice browser.", 
    "So your same information that you want to use, depending on your style sheet,", 
    "will work either with an iPad type screen or with audio, with a", 
    "microphone and speaker interface.", 
    "So that's a thing that happens.", 
    "Separate branding, so whether you're trying to target--", 
    "you've got a company.", 
    "You're trying to target pre-teens.", 
    "And you're trying to target baby boomers.", 
    "You can figure out who they are often by the information that's there.", 
    "And you want your page to look differently for those two groups, you", 
    "can do that with style sheets.", 
    "And then, often, they'll be developers, coders and designers,", 
    "they're separate parallel groups and the separation of the concerns makes", 
    "it a little easier.", 
    "So that's the reasons they've done that.", 
    "And the best practice today is there shouldn't be any styling in the HTML,", 
    "in the markup language.", 
    "That's just information and you do the styling separately.", 
    "And we'll show you how those things are linked together.", 
    "In the meantime, what I'll do is give you some examples.", 
    "I think I'll give you examples.", 
    "OK, so, first of all, let's just look at some HTML.", 
    "If I turn on the developer tools in Firefox, there's", 
    "something called Web Developer.", 
    "And I think I can do a page source.", 
    "So this is what HTML looks like.", 
    "You've probably seen it.", 
    "Let's see, title, you see here.", 
    "Computer science division, here it is in the big font.", 
    "Here it is right here.", 
    "Hope I could blow that up.", 
    "All right, so here it is in the HTML.", 
    "Here's what it looks like on the page with the style sheets.", 
    "You see we have a table that starts and there's a bunch", 
    "of rows in the table.", 
    "And that's just giving these lists of information, ECS logo, and things,", 
    "College of Engineering.", 
    "This is a table that's put here.", 
    "And it's this just very verbose format to be able to put that in.", 
    "So that's HTML.", 
    "And this very cool feature called Web Developer, you can see", 
    "what's going on.", 
    "One of the other features in Web Developer, that was view page source.", 
    "And if we do an Inspect on Firefox we can go see what's going on here.", 
    "How are these things tagged?", 
    "Oh, that's a table.", 
    "Here's some tagged with the [INAUDIBLE] things.", 
    "That's a header, and so on, you can just point at it.", 
    "Here's the images, and see what's on there.", 
    "So one of the nice things about HTML is you can learn about it by seeing", 
    "what other people are doing.", 
    "All right, so let me turn that off.", 
    "If you're going to be doing this kind of work, you need to become web", 
    "developer [INAUDIBLE] friends.", 
    "Now, in terms of style sheets, the Altarena Playhouse.", 
    "This is what Armando does in his copious spare time.", 
    "He's the music director there.", 
    "And his gift to them was to create a box office system to", 
    "buy and sell tickets.", 
    "So, once he had this working for his home theater, the Altarena, other", 
    "people approached him.", 
    "And so, the very same code, like this custom made theater, the only", 
    "difference between these two is the style sheet.", 
    "He changed the style.", 
    "It's the same code with different style sheets.", 
    "He's able to provide that.", 
    "A very impressive one if you want to see what you can do with style sheets,", 
    "it's called the CSS Zen garden.", 
    "And what I'm going to start off to do is show you, if you go into page", 
    "source, under view, and to page source.", 
    "And you do in the page style, and you say take away the CSS.", 
    "What does it look like?", 
    "And it's like going back in time.", 
    "This is like what my web page looks like.", 
    "My web page looks like that.", 
    "So all the information is there.", 
    "Let's instead turn page source back on, the current style.", 
    "And let's try some others.", 
    "And they even give the name of the people who created them.", 
    "So they're like artists.", 
    "OK, that was one.", 
    "There's another.", 
    "You see how the words ended up on the signs there.", 
    "Here's is another one, a patriotic one.", 
    "Here's a more attractive one.", 
    "OK, more fun, you're seeing, the code's not changing,", 
    "just the style sheet.", 
    "So if you follow the advice, put the style in the code, you can get all", 
    "these different looks, amazingly different looks, just", 
    "with the style sheet.", 
    "OK, so that's stuff that it looks like.", 
    "So, how do they do this?", 
    "How do they pull this off?", 
    "So that's what when we said, remember I said, you just do the information", 
    "right now with the mock-ups, and get the information, and we do the style", 
    "sheets later once you're happy with it.", 
    "I think I did all that.", 
    "This is how it looks.", 
    "What you'll see on the web page is a link to the style sheet.", 
    "Every one, you'll see it somewhere on that page, it'll be that link there.", 
    "And what they use is the HTML id and class attributes.", 
    "And they use the id and class attributes to find the pieces of the", 
    "page that you want to style in certain ways.", 
    "So an id, in this terminology, has to be unique to the page.", 
    "There can only be that one name.", 
    "The class can be attached to a lot of elements.", 
    "And so, this is an example for this div.", 
    "This div is just a collection of elements.", 
    "That's one of them.", 
    "And there's span, which is another kind of collection of elements.", 
    "So the id is right and the class is content.", 
    "This is the form.", 
    "So then I could select things by right or I could select things by content.", 
    "There's multiple ways to select them and apply the style sheets to them.", 
    "So here's a specific example of a page.", 
    "So the tag name is h1.", 
    "I could apply a style sheet to everything that's named h1.", 
    "Notice, there's two ways--", 
    "or I could do the class name.", 
    "The class name is pageFrame, use the dot to mean it's a class name.", 
    "So say the class name is pageFrame that selects it.", 
    "Or you can say the element id is #pageHead.", 
    "And see pageHead's over here with the id.", 
    "And the sharp symbol says it's an id.", 
    "So both of these things do the collect the same thing.", 
    "So you could do it two different ways to show off how clever you are.", 
    "That's a bad idea.", 
    "Stick to one way and do it the same way.", 
    "Decide which way you want to do, names or ids, but don't go back and forth", 
    "throughout your code because it's confusing.", 
    "This is the tag and the class name to do it together.", 
    "Here is the tag name and an id.", 
    "These are usually redundant.", 
    "Here is an important idea.", 
    "When there's a space there, that looks just like a blank, that actually means", 
    "something here.", 
    "This means first find the thing that's identified with this.", 
    "And once you've found it, then apply this inside that.", 
    "So that blank is not just a syntactic accident.", 
    "It actually is serious.", 
    "And the attributes inherit the browser defaults unless overwritten.", 
    "So that's the HTML.", 
    "With that, I think we're ready for another quiz.", 
    "This one is harder.", 
    "I'll just say, I guarantee this one's harder.", 
    "Which of these will only select the word bar for styling?", 
    "So we're trying to use the id and the class to find something to style,", 
    "here's three different things, or do all of them all select bar?", 
    "And so, this is a harder one to figure out."
