    "be fun, call it big design up front", 
    "The first phase is the requirements analysis and", 
    "specification.", 
    "You can imagine if you're building a microprocessor", 
    "you'd really want to get that spec down there for people who", 
    "can go ahead.", 
    "And that's when people start building software that way.", 
    "Then an architecture design.", 
    "What's going to be the modules, how it's going to", 
    "connect together.", 
    "Then you start coding and integrating pieces together.", 
    "Not only is it different steps that take 6 or 12 months each,", 
    "but it'll be different people even.", 
    "There'd be people do requirements, architecture,", 
    "people who code, the verification team could be", 
    "separate, and then operations and maintenance would be", 
    "separate from that.", 
    "This model--", 
    "so you fall from one to the other --- well why would you", 
    "do it that way?", 
    "Well, the idea is the earlier you catch the bug the cheaper", 
    "it is, which is true.", 
    "If you could get rid of a bug in the requirements stage", 
    "instead of waiting until the operation stage", 
    "it's much less expensive.", 
    "So it makes sense.", 
    "The other thing that you do is because these things last a", 
    "long time, is you got to do extensive documentation", 
    "because some people will leave and new people will come in,", 
    "and they have to catch up.", 
    "So a lot of writing --", 
    "a slow process.", 
    "How well does it work?", 
    "Or what does it work well for?", 
    "It's great for Curiosity spacecraft on Mars.", 
    "It's going to be really hard to fix Curiosity once it's out", 
    "there, so you really want a very tight spec.", 
    "Aircraft control.", 
    "I'm sure those of you flying you like the JetBlue planes.", 
    "They have really great, carefully written software.", 
    "So it's good for those things.", 
    "But a lot of software that we use today, once the customer", 
    "sees it-- and you'll go through this--", 
    "that's not what they want.", 
    "They see it.", 
    "Boy, now that I see what you've done I thought that's", 
    "what I wanted, but now I realize I", 
    "want something different.", 
    "The other thing that happens with the Waterfall model is", 
    "after you build it you've got a much better idea how you", 
    "should have done it.", 
    "This is actually captured in the saying here by Fred Brooks", 
    "is \"Plan to throw one away.", 
    "You will anyhow.\" So his idea, you should throw this away.", 
    "So we're going to both in the book and in the course, we're", 
    "going to quote Turing Award winners.", 
    "You can't get a Nobel Prize in computer science.", 
    "It's not one of the fields.", 
    "So the highest award in computer science is the Turing", 
    "Award from the Association for Computing Machinery.", 
    "Fred Brooks is one of my personal heroes, got it for", 
    "making big contributions in three things: architecture,", 
    "operating systems, and software engineering.", 
    "And he wrote probably one of the most famous computer", 
    "science books of all time, The Mythical Man-Month, about his", 
    "experience trying to do software for the", 
    "IBM operating system.", 
    "Anyway, his thing, chances are you're going to throw it away.", 
    "So this is a criticism of the Waterfall model for a lot of", 
    "software development.", 
    "So, not surprisingly, if people complained about the", 
    "Waterfall, people would come up with a", 
    "new lifecycle approach.", 
    "And this one's called the Spiral approach.", 
    "And you'll see for the next slide that the idea is, let's", 
    "build a prototype going through all those phases that", 
    "we talked about for Waterfall development, but we'll build a", 
    "prototype each step.", 
    "And we won't do all the requirements.", 
    "We'll just do some of them until we understand it.", 
    "And then we'll do some more and do some more.", 
    "And after a few iterations around the spiral, we'll", 
    "actually have a working prototype.", 
    "So this is the slide that we use in the book.", 
    "You start off over here in this quadrant, determine the", 
    "objectives and constraints.", 
    "The next step is you look at a bunch of options, which way to", 
    "build it, identify what the risks are, and resolve them.", 
    "Then you build the prototype.", 
    "And once that's done, you figure out the next iteration.", 
    "So you spiral around.", 
    "With every iteration, you evolve the prototype until you", 
    "finally have something operational.", 
    "So this involves the customers more rather than you get a", 
    "contract, you go build it, and you come back in two years,", 
    "and say, this is what you asked us to do.", 
    "And then the customer doesn't like it.", 
    "The problems with Spiral.", 
    "It still takes a long time.", 
    "The good news, the customer is involved, but it still takes a", 
    "long time, even up to two years.", 
    "So customers can and will change their minds.", 
    "And then this quote I heard from actually another Turing", 
    "Award winner that he found anonymously on some bulletin", 
    "board, \"And the users exclaimed with a laugh and a", 
    "taunt, it's just what we asked for, but not what we want.\" So", 
    "that's a sad but true thing.", 
    "So here we are.", 
    "We're in this field.", 
    "We're kind of problem solvers naturally, so there's this", 
    "problem about customers who say they want one", 
    "thing and change it.", 
    "What are we going to do?", 
    "One of my favorite sayings is from Shimon Peres.", 
    "He says, \"If a problem has no solution, it may not be a", 
    "problem, but a fact, not to be solved, but to coped with over", 
    "time.\" So if you get married and you get a long time.", 
    "My wife will tell me what I think of as a problem she", 
    "wants solved, and that's not what she wants.", 
    "It's a fact to be coped with over time.", 
    "But you will be in situations where you'll realize that", 
    "there's this problem, and you keep trying to solve it, and", 
    "it's not solvable.", 
    "Then it's not really a problem.", 
    "It's a fact.", 
    "You've got to cope with it.", 
    "So this is the real world, right.", 
    "That's what we do.", 
    "So this led a group of people to this", 
    "relatively amazing statement.", 
    "They got together in a workshop.", 
    "They were frustrated with trying to build software", 
    "using, say, the Spiral model.", 
    "And they do these contracts.", 
    "And they build it.", 
    "And the customers don't like it.", 
    "And it behind budget.", 
    "And people make fun of them.", 
    "And rockets blow up.", 
    "So they said, we're going to fix this.", 
    "And I think of it as like Martin Luther", 
    "almost 400 years ago.", 
    "Unhappy with the Catholic Church, he takes his 95 theses", 
    "and nails it to the door of the Catholic church, a", 
    "Reformation moment.", 
    "So this is the software reformation", 
    "moment, the Agile Manifesto.", 
    "And what I'm putting in this slide is actually what they", 
    "wrote, what they put on the door of the Big Design Up", 
    "Front church.", 
    "This is what they nailed up there.", 
    "This is their saying.", 
    "\"We are uncovering better ways of developing SW by doing it", 
    "in helping others do it.", 
    "\"Through this work we have come to value individuals and", 
    "interactions over processes and tools\"--", 
    "so working with customers, the interactions with", 
    "people on the team--", 
    "\"working software over comprehensive documentation\"--", 
    "so this working prototype idea--", 
    "\"customer collaboration over contract negotiation\"--", 
    "rather than a big legal contract and you argue what", 
    "these things need, skip all that stuff.", 
    "Let's work with the customer and figure out", 
    "what's going on.", 
    "And their final one was \"responding to change over", 
    "following a plan.\" Rather than a legal contract and a plan", 
    "and you stick with it and you build this thing, the", 
    "customers doesn't like it, we're going to be much more", 
    "interactive with customers.", 
    "And their final sentence, \"That is, while there is value", 
    "of items on the right\"-- we're not saying", 
    "those things are useless--", 
    "\"we value the items on the left more.\" So this was the", 
    "Agile Manifesto nailed to the door of the Big Design Up", 
    "Front, and that led to the Agile lifecycle, which is what", 
    "we're using in this class.", 
    "Change is a fact of life.", 
    "Right?", 
    "It's not one of these problems to be solved.", 
    "It's a fact to be coped with.", 
    "And they're going to do continuous improvement over", 
    "these big phases sometimes done by different people over", 
    "time [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "Continuously refine incomplete but working prototypes until", 
    "the customer is happy.", 
    "And you get the feedback almost", 
    "continuously, every two weeks.", 
    "And that's what we'll do in this class.", 
    "It emphasizes test-driven development.", 
    "What does test-driven development or TTD mean?", 
    "You write the test before you write the code.", 
    "User stories.", 
    "These are you'll work with the customer, write down.", 
    "You would agree on how you-- here's an example of a user", 
    "using that software.", 
    "You write that down before you build the software.", 
    "Those are user stories.", 
    "And another example is big problem software it takes much", 
    "longer than everybody thinks.", 
    "So you use Velocity.", 
    "You'll keep track of how many user stories you get done", 
    "every week or two and to predict how much longer the", 
    "project is going to take.", 
    "So this Agile lifecycle and iteration in here is reflected", 
    "in this flowchart, and it also maps onto the", 
    "chapters of the book.", 
    "So talk to the customer, in this case", 
    "nontechnical customer.", 
    "We then go to kind of two phases of test-driven", 
    "development, which is behavior-driven design.", 
    "You get the behavior you want through these user stories.", 
    "Then we go through test-driven development.", 
    "You write the test before you use it.", 
    "Next measuring is velocity talks about-- you", 
    "deploy in the cloud.", 
    "That's how TA's is going to evaluate it.", 
    "That's an iteration.", 
    "You go back and do it again.", 
    "What about the legacy stuff?", 
    "Well, it turns out, good news from our perspective, is", 
    "Armando read books about.", 
    "The same techniques of behavior-driven design and", 
    "test-driven development are useful in", 
    "dealing with legacy code.", 
    "Basically, if it's undocumented, you need to", 
    "write some test about the part you want to change.", 
    "And you'll use those same techniques", 
    "before you change it.", 
    "And then another big idea that's important in software", 
    "engineering is to have a good architecture.", 
    "If you have a lousy architecture, you're going to", 
    "have lousy code.", 
    "And we'll talk about design patterns in the course.", 
    "This is the course.", 
    "And you'll see this pattern a lot in the book.", 
    "With that, it's time for another quiz here.", 
    "So what is not a key difference between Waterfall", 
    "and Spiral and Agile lifecycles?", 
    "So the first one, Waterfall uses long phases.", 
    "Agile uses quick iterations, Spiral long iterations.", 
    "Is that false?", 
    "Waterfall has no working code at the end.", 
    "Spiral and Agile have working code with each iteration.", 
    "Waterfall and Spiral use written requirements, but", 
    "Agile does not use anything written.", 
    "Waterfall and Spiral will have architecture design phases,", 
    "but you cannot incorporate software architecture in the", 
    "Agile lifecycle.", 
    "Which one's false?"
