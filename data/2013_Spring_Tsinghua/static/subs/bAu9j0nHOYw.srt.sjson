    "DAVID PATTERSON: User can search for movie by title.", 
    "Well, which ones are really specific?", 
    "Red's pretty specific, 99% of the Add Movie pages will", 
    "appear within 3 seconds.", 
    "Is that testable?", 
    "You could imagine, is it relevant?", 
    "The responsiveness of an application.", 
    "And can you timebox it?", 
    "Yeah, you can figure out if you hit that.", 
    "Blue, top 10 movies sold by price.", 
    "So by cheapest one first.", 
    "That one's pretty specific.", 
    "At the bottom two, it'd be \"search for a movie by title,\" and \"Rotten", 
    "Potatoes should have a good response time.\" Well, maybe the first one isn't", 
    "a lot of detail.", 
    "Search by title--", 
    "I guess, as opposed to search by director or something.", 
    "But good response time we can't measure.", 
    "It's unmeasurable.", 
    "So it's apple pie and motherhood kind of thing, but not", 
    "something that's testable.", 
    "So it's probably the least smart of the ones there.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So this section, the next one, is Introducing Cucumber.", 
    "We'll do a demo.", 
    "I would say that Cucumber's the tool it sold me on this Rail thing.", 
    "It feels like magic.", 
    "I just can't believe that you can have a software tool that's going to take", 
    "those 3\" x 5\" cards that we talked about, and turn them into tests.", 
    "What an amazing thing to have happen.", 
    "So let me go through the big idea first.", 
    "We're going to take these customer-friendly user stories, and", 
    "turn them into these acceptance tests.", 
    "It used to be these big contracts in the Waterfall design, and even", 
    "integration tests, to make sure that things all work together to", 
    "be able to do that.", 
    "Cucumber finds this really great midway point to what the developer", 
    "wants and what the customer wants.", 
    "The user stories don't really look like code.", 
    "You saw them on those 3\" x 5\" cards.", 
    "So it's understandable to the customer, and can be", 
    "used to reach agreement.", 
    "So you should be doing that when you start building these apps.", 
    "But they're also not completely free-form.", 
    "There's restrictions on the style.", 
    "It's got its own kind of syntax approach to it.", 
    "So it's not completely free-form, but clearly understandable, so that you", 
    "can get real tests from it.", 
    "That's the art of Cucumber.", 
    "So this is what user stories look like in Cucumber.", 
    "Instead of using the words \"user story,\" they used the word \"scenario.\"", 
    "So the first is a feature.", 
    "There's one of these features per what we might consider a user story.", 
    "And there's one or more scenarios.", 
    "A particular user story could have multiple scenarios.", 
    "And then there's lots of steps per scenario.", 
    "So its feature, multiple scenarios, and then steps per scenario.", 
    "This is the idea here.", 
    "And we'll talk about the content of those things on the next few slides.", 
    "But that's what it looks like in Cucumber.", 
    "So use the user story refers to the single feature.", 
    "A features has one more scenarios that show different ways that", 
    "features can be used.", 
    "And the key words, \"feature\" and \"scenario\" identify those components.", 
    "That's not too surprising.", 
    "And then the steps make up the scenario.", 
    "Step definitions are the Ruby code that tests the step.", 
    "So there's going to be steps and their definitions.", 
    "And there's usually many steps will use the same definition, so you get to", 
    "reuse that.", 
    "So then there are these keywords of this stylized ones.", 
    "And Given represents the state of the world before the event.", 
    "You can think of it as pre-condition.", 
    "So in your user story, Given will say, what was it like before we started?", 
    "When represents the event, like pushing a button.", 
    "And then Then says what happens.", 
    "The expected outcome.", 
    "So you could be writing your user your story in this stylized form of Given", 
    "and When and Then.", 
    "And you can use conjunctions.", 
    "You can do And.", 
    "Given this and this and this, When that happens, Then this should happen,", 
    "And, And, And.", 
    "So you can have multiple steps there with conjunctions.", 
    "But they end up being pretty readable.", 
    "So let's just keep this in track.", 
    "So user stories are kept inside of Rails, as we'll see soon.", 
    "There's a separate place to look for--", 
    "There's the convention where you look for the files that are the steps.", 
    "And then the Ruby code that does the testing, there's a separate place in", 
    "the hierarchy where the step definitions are found.", 
    "And you can think of the step definitions like method definitions.", 
    "And you can think the steps of the scenarios are like method calls.", 
    "That's the analogy there.", 
    "So you write the steps in, it's like invoking the methods that are in the", 
    "step definitions.", 
    "So now here's the magic part.", 
    "Now we've got steps and step definitions.", 
    "How are we going to map those together?", 
    "We've got these steps, and what looks like stilted English, and we've got", 
    "this Ruby code.", 
    "How we're going to match those together?", 
    "And the big insight was, we'll use regular expressions.", 
    "We will just use regular expressions which we've learned to match the", 
    "English text, and use the recognition, and isolating the parameters out of", 
    "that, and using that to invoke the right step definitions.", 
    "So English Ruby code regular expression matching [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "and puts that together.", 
    "And then they put that in the Cucumber tool and have a nice user interface.", 
    "They color the steps.", 
    "When you run Cucumber, after you've run them, they'll color", 
    "the steps for you.", 
    "If it passed, it's green.", 
    "If it's yellow, it's not implemented.", 
    "Red, it failed.", 
    "And all the steps that follow the failing step won't even be run, so", 
    "they'll be listed blue, because they haven't done it yet.", 
    "And then what your goal is, is to make all the steps", 
    "greens, because it passed.", 
    "And that's where the name came from.", 
    "The girlfriend of the guy who came up with it suggested \"cucumber\" because", 
    "it's a green vegetable, and so that's where the name comes from.", 
    "So next step--", 
    "I'll just go right ahead--", 
    "is running Cucumber in Capybara.", 
    "I don't think a lot of people know what Capybara is.", 
    "It's the largest rodent in the world.", 
    "It's like a dog-size rodent.", 
    "And it replaced a tool called Webrat.", 
    "And so Webrat became Capybara because it's even better than Webrat.", 
    "That's Capybara.", 
    "So what's Capybara?", 
    "Why do we need a tool like Webrat or Capybara?", 
    "We need something to test, because we got this request response code.", 
    "We need something to act like a user to test our stuff.", 
    "Capybara simulates a browser for you.", 
    "It doesn't click on the browser.", 
    "It acts like [INAUDIBLE].", 
    "It can interact and receive pages, parse HTML, submit", 
    "forms as a user would.", 
    "So Capybara acts like a user--", 
    "just what you need to test your user interface code.", 
    "However, it can't handle JavaScript.", 
    "Capybara's much faster than WebDriver, which can handle JavaScript.", 
    "But if you don't need to the JavaScript, you don't want to use it,", 
    "because it runs a lot slower.", 
    "You'd like to use Capybara, and that's what we'll use here.", 
    "Right.", 
    "And now comes the exciting part for the instructor--", 
    "is the demo.", 
    "So what we're going to do is show Cucumber working.", 
    "And rather than adding a new feature, which you normally could, we're just", 
    "going to use Cucumber to show an existing feature that's in it.", 
    "And we're doing this just for pedagogic reasons.", 
    "I'll do this demo now, but we could also do it as a screen cast.", 
    "So we're going to--", 
    "Let me just show you the pieces here.", 
    "The feature that we're going to add is this one.", 
    "User can manually add movies.", 
    "And you see, it's colorized this in the text setter.", 
    "Here's the \"scenario\" keyword and the \"feature\" keyword.", 
    "Given I am on the RottenPotatoes homepage, when I follow Add New Movie,", 
    "Then I should be on the Create Movie page.", 
    "When I fill in Title with Men in Black, And I select PG-13 from Rating,", 
    "and I press Save Changes, Then I should be in the RottenPotatoes home", 
    "page, And I should see Men in Black.", 
    "You could imagine that conversation with a customer, and", 
    "writing that down.", 
    "But that is in the language that Cucumber can understand.", 
    "So now what I'm going to do is--", 
    "and this is located in RottenPotatoes, in the features file.", 
    "And the name of this feature is AddMovie.feature.", 
    "So that's what I'm looking at there.", 
    "So Cucumber knows this exists, and it's going to try and test it.", 
    "And also, I have to do is go up here and write \"Cucumber\"--", 
    "If I can spell \"cucumber.\" And it's going to take a little bit.", 
    "We'll pause and see it go.", 
    "And so it's going to go through these steps.", 
    "And there it is, then the colors.", 
    "And let's go back.", 
    "First of all, at the bottom, it said, of the one scenario it failed--", 
    "Of the eight steps, one failed and seven were skipped.", 
    "You can see here, it's in blue.", 
    "Those are the steps it didn't even try.", 
    "And let's go back up to--", 
    "there we go.", 
    "Given I am on the RottenPotatoes homepage.", 
    "This is all in red.", 
    "It didn't pass.", 
    "And look at error message we got.", 
    "I can't find a mapping from the RottenPotatoes homepage to a path.", 
    "OK, that's the problem.", 
    "Now, not only does it say that, it tells you what to do next.", 
    "It says, now go add a mapping over here, right there, and paths.rb.", 
    "You idiot, you didn't put the path there.", 
    "There's where it's got to be fixed.", 
    "Go do it!", 
    "OK.", 
    "So we'll follow this advice.", 
    "So let's copy that name.", 
    "And Copy.", 
    "Yup.", 
    "So we've copied that name, and now we're going to go find paths.rb, and", 
    "just do what it tells us to do.", 
    "It's not positive it's the right thing to do, but--", 
    "OK so when we go--", 
    "see, we were in paths.rb, and here's where you would add this.", 
    "So now we're going to add When.", 
    "It starts.", 
    "That's the hat sign.", 
    "That's the beginning of the line.", 
    "And I've got to make sure I use the Paste.", 
    "OK.", 
    "When I am on that page, on the RottenPotatoes page, now what I have", 
    "to do is figure out, what is the path?", 
    "Well, I will go back, over to this window?", 
    "No?", 
    "This Window.", 
    "And scroll down.", 
    "And now, I run Rake Routes to figure out what the path is I need.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Rake Route.", 
    "It's telling me all kinds of things.", 
    "OK, now we're going to look for when I want to do index, where is", 
    "it supposed to go?", 
    "There's index over there.", 
    "I'm supposed to go to /movies.", 
    "And let me copy that.", 
    "So if I go back to the paths.rb, that's think you told me to fix.", 
    "When I'm on that page, I want to go to /movie.", 
    "And put this at the end.", 
    "All right.", 
    "I ran Cucumber.", 
    "It told me I forgot to put a path in for this thing, so I added the path it", 
    "told me to fix.", 
    "And I will go back to Cucumber again, and run it again.", 
    "So I sure hope, since it told me to fix that, that that first step passes,", 
    "because I did what it told me to do.", 
    "So I hope that step's going to be green.", 
    "And then we'll see what it runs into next.", 
    "How far does it get?", 
    "OK.", 
    "It said, two pass this time.", 
    "So one failed, five skipped, two passed.", 
    "The first two passed, and then one failed, and there's eight steps there.", 
    "It skipped all the others.", 
    "So let's go back up and see what happened.", 
    "Given I'm on the RottenPotatoes home page, that passed.", 
    "When I follow Add New Movie, that passed.", 
    "Then I should be on Create New Movie page.", 
    "Can't find the Create New Movie page to a path.", 
    "Now go into paths and add that path.", 
    "OK.", 
    "I will follow that.", 
    "I'll copy.", 
    "And go to paths.rb.", 
    "And I'm going to do it right after this one.", 
    "When?", 
    "At the beginning of the line.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Slash.", 
    "Now what do I put in there?", 
    "If I go back, and look at the Rake Routes--", 
    "which I think I can just scroll and find the Rake Routes.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So this one was new.", 
    "The last one was indexed, this one's new.", 
    "So this is the path I want.", 
    "I go in there, copy it.", 
    "OK.", 
    "And paths.rb.", 
    "Oops.", 
    "I think I went down the line.", 
    "I've done something wrong here.", 
    "And now I paste from Rake Routes the path that I wanted.", 
    "And then I write that.", 
    "And I should go back to try Cucumber again.", 
    "So last time, we have two green.", 
    "So let's see what happens.", 
    "We hope we fixed the failed one.", 
    "We'll see how many of the ones that follow.", 
    "Will they work now, or will they fail as well?", 
    "OK.", 
    "Add the movie.", 
    "Oh, that looked pretty colorful.", 
    "Eight paths.", 
    "So you can see, Given I am on the Rotten homepages?", 
    "Yep.", 
    "Cucumber said, that's green.", 
    "When I follow Add New Movie--", 
    "yup.", 
    "Then I should be on the Create New Movie Page.", 
    "Yep.", 
    "And when I filled in title with Men in Black and I selected PG-13, yeah.", 
    "That all worked.", 
    "I could do that.", 
    "And I should see Men in Black.", 
    "So it was a feature we already had, but it went and", 
    "verified that it all worked.", 
    "So not only would act as an acceptance test, but also, if we were to change", 
    "it in the future, we'd want to run this again, make sure I", 
    "didn't break it.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So that's Cucumber in action, running Cucumber.", 
    "So like I said, amazingly enough, we go from 3\" x 5\" cards and Ruby codes", 
    "to integrate them together at this halfway point.", 
    "The steps, the steps definitions, the regular expressions to make them all", 
    "fit together.", 
    "And it's not that hard to do.", 
    "And it's just kind of an amazing thing you can use Cucumber for.", 
    "Cucumber's not limited to Ruby.", 
    "You could use it for other languages as well.", 
    "But you can still get this English-style description of what the", 
    "acceptance test features that you want to do.", 
    "Armando may even do an example where he takes his Apple 2, and writes Ruby", 
    "Cucumber code to verify that he can develop code on the Apple 2.", 
    "Because all you need is the ability to see if it can follow the advice.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So that's the example.", 
    "Let's do our questions.", 
    "All right.", 
    "'Which is false about Cucumber and Capybara?\" Cucumber and Capybara can", 
    "perform acceptance tests and integration tests.", 
    "A feature has one or more user stories, and which are typically", 
    "composed of three to eight steps.", 
    "Steps use Given for current state, When for action, Then for consequences", 
    "of actions.", 
    "And Cucumber matches step definitions to scenario steps using regular", 
    "expressions, and Capybara pretends to be the user that interacts with the", 
    "SaaS app accordingly."
