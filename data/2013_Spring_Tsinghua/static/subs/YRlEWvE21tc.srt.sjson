    "DAVID PATTERSON: Today we're going to wrap up the Rails stuff, talk about", 
    "debugging, which Armando skipped last time, finishing up CRUD, some", 
    "fallacies and pitfalls.", 
    "We'll introduce you to the behavior-driven design.", 
    "This is kind of, finally, we're there, we're starting to be", 
    "able to produce code.", 
    "And we'll talk--", 
    "how we're going to do that with working with nontechnical customers,", 
    "cool technology that anybody who doesn't have programming can help you", 
    "design the app and what features you want.", 
    "And then let's see how fast it goes.", 
    "We'll do a bunch of demos today, including the first use of the, I", 
    "think, the most important tool or the most amazing tool in this whole class.", 
    "We'll be showing you that today.", 
    "And then we'll see if there's extra time or not, and have some", 
    "features at the end.", 
    "So, first up is things going wrong, debugging.", 
    "As Armando says, I guess I'm naturally an optimist.", 
    "He says he's naturally a pessimist.", 
    "It may be more from his years of programming.", 
    "I think programmers are natural optimists-- nah, this is", 
    "going to work fine.", 
    "I don't have to write comments.", 
    "Why should I include the debugger when it's running?", 
    "It's going to work, I know it is.", 
    "And after some number of decades of that being true, then maybe you do it.", 
    "So in the book and what we'll talk about is some", 
    "techniques to do with debugging.", 
    "And particularly, things are a little different with Software as a Service.", 
    "It's really not a standard error, right?", 
    "It's this request response thing, and there's just not a terminal you can", 
    "easily write it to.", 
    "Another really hard part is it's got a lot of moving parts.", 
    "We've got all these moving parts, and we've got these relationships.", 
    "And it's a pipeline, and something that happens in the controller won't", 
    "immediately manifest itself.", 
    "You may not see it until the renderer.", 
    "But the problem is in the controller, not in the renderer.", 
    "So it's got this kind of time delay.", 
    "And in Software as a Service you can have, if you're", 
    "lucky, millions of customers.", 
    "There can be bugs that only affect some users, not others.", 
    "Bugs that only affect some routes and not others.", 
    "And so that makes it harder to do.", 
    "Then it always fails.", 
    "So here's three classic techniques that you do with the kind of standard", 
    "computers and what happens here.", 
    "Now, keep in mind that part of this Rails framework, to make it really", 
    "easy for you to build apps that people can really do, they consciously have a", 
    "development mode and a production mode.", 
    "So what debugging techniques can you use during development, and which ones", 
    "you better not use during production mode?", 
    "Well, printing to the terminal--", 
    "you can do anything you want in development mode.", 
    "You can even print to the terminal.", 
    "You can try it.", 
    "It's going come out, race by on your screen, and be hard to see, but you", 
    "can get away with that.", 
    "You better not do that in production code, or you'll get messages to your", 
    "management that, hey, this message came up when I tried to use it, didn't", 
    "understand.", 
    "Logging means putting it into a permanent log.", 
    "You can write to the log file.", 
    "What's nice about that-- the log file is anything you've written, it's not", 
    "going to be lost.", 
    "You can go back and view it later.", 
    "It helps you figure out what happened.", 
    "And you can, in development mode, actually stop it and invoke the", 
    "debugger, which we'll show you shortly, and interact and check", 
    "variables and stuff like that, like you can in kind", 
    "of traditional programs.", 
    "So you may use one of those things.", 
    "So Armando, who's spent a lot of his time, in his spare time, in developing", 
    "software for a movie theater where he's the artistic director, has a lot", 
    "of experience in doing this.", 
    "And so they captured it in acronyms, RASP.", 
    "So debugging is a fact of life.", 
    "The four tips is first, actually read the error message.", 
    "You just don't say, I've got an error message.", 
    "This is what I do with Armando--", 
    "I got an error message.", 
    "It didn't work.", 
    "And he says, Dave, read the error message, seriously.", 
    "Some programmer wrote this long message there to give you a hint", 
    "what's wrong.", 
    "And it's trying to tell you something.", 
    "So actually, start by reading your error message.", 
    "Second thing is-- and I skipped one, I went directly to ask Armando--", 
    "is ask a colleague, but ask him an informed question.", 
    "Say something like--", 
    "I was trying to do this, I did what I thought was right.", 
    "I tried to do it, but when I expected foo, I got", 
    "something completely different.", 
    "Here's the error message.", 
    "And I've learned to explicitly give the error message.", 
    "But ask a colleague.", 
    "If you're doing pair programming, which we tried out, that makes it", 
    "really easy.", 
    "That's a good way to do it.", 
    "And sometimes, at least my experience is, just asking your colleague the", 
    "question, before the colleague can answer you-- oh, I know what it is.", 
    "But just formulating the question-- you've laid it out in a way somebody", 
    "can answer it-- you can figure it out yourself.", 
    "The good news, today, is the next step, if the first two don't work, you", 
    "can go to search.", 
    "A typical thing that a lot of people do, right?", 
    "You take the error message, you slam it into your favorite search engine,", 
    "you search and see what the answers are.", 
    "And even better, there's StackOverflow.", 
    "StackOverflow rocks.", 
    "This is the thing--", 
    "StackOverflow invented the thing that we're using to do the massive open", 
    "online courses-- a way for a group of people to get questions answered.", 
    "And both the questions and the answers get saved over time, you can go back", 
    "and mine them.", 
    "So searching--", 
    "and, particularly, this works well if this particular version of Ruby or", 
    "this particular version of the gem has the problem and others don't--", 
    "boy, things like StackOverflow and searching can really help you with", 
    "those problems.", 
    "Now, if R, A, and S doesn't work-- you actually read it, the colleague can't", 
    "help, and you searched-- then you can go ahead and use StackOverflow for", 
    "what it was intended, which is to post questions on it, or you could use the", 
    "Piazza Forum.", 
    "Now, especially all of us who are using Piazza, we're all busy people,", 
    "well, particularly the StackOverflow people are busy people.", 
    "So you just don't throw, hey, it didn't work and slam 100 lines of", 
    "error messages into the StackOverflow posts.", 
    "That's not going to work.", 
    "Try and figure out the minimal information that still reproduces that", 
    "result and put it up there.", 
    "And kind of amazingly, in StackOverflow, and there's an example", 
    "in the book, a really hard thing, within minutes you can", 
    "get an answer back.", 
    "So if you use it carefully, it's a really great tool.", 
    "So, let's go over this example.", 
    "And I'll show this in a demo shortly.", 
    "But you can use the backtrace that's available in Rails to see really where", 
    "the error came from.", 
    "Now I think this specific example I'm going to do, is a really common", 
    "message that you get is this undefined method, foo for nil of class nil.", 
    "Nil class is a special class that just has nil in it.", 
    "But it really means you--", 
    "very typically, like 90% of the time, it failed in that it got an error that", 
    "you didn't check.", 
    "So this specific example-- we'll do an example--", 
    "is you search a movie by ID, you assume the movie's in there.", 
    "But what happens if the user put a ID that doesn't actually match a movie in", 
    "the database?", 
    "Well, you're going to get the nil object, and you'll get this message.", 
    "So, let me see if I can make this work.", 
    "All right.", 
    "All right.", 
    "Now, am I in-- yep, I'm in Rotten Potatoes.", 
    "And so I want to do Rails server minus minus debugger, and fire that up.", 
    "Right, it's going to take a little while to get going.", 
    "OK, there it is.", 
    "All right.", 
    "Now, let's just try a movie that, for the route that really doesn't exist,", 
    "we'll do movie 999.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Now, so what happened is it gives-- this is one of the nice", 
    "things about Rails.", 
    "Look at the error message it gives.", 
    "First of all, it tells us, hey, the active record had a problem.", 
    "You typed this ID in.", 
    "And then it not only says that, it says here's the route of", 
    "where it came from.", 
    "And it actually says the problem was in Show, where", 
    "exactly the problem happened.", 
    "Now what we can also do is, if this isn't enough information, it says,", 
    "well, I guess it's line 14 in Show, I think is what it's saying.", 
    "We can actually do an application trace, this will", 
    "result in a lot of stuff.", 
    "No, is the framework trace?", 
    "All right.", 
    "And somewhere in here you'll be able to find when the service was invoked.", 
    "And then, if that's not enough information, usually it's in", 
    "the first few lines.", 
    "You can really--", 
    "this really goes on and on.", 
    "But this is all built-in.", 
    "One of the nice thing about Rails is it's an interactive system.", 
    "It's not--", 
    "the methods are compiled, and you can't get them.", 
    "You can--", 
    "it's done at runtime, and you can go and interrogate", 
    "them using the debugger.", 
    "If you stick the debugger information into the methods where it is, you'll", 
    "stop it right where it is in its tracks.", 
    "And just like any old interpreter, even though this is a very", 
    "sophisticated system, you can go in and use it.", 
    "And like other software, you can stick kind of print statements in it.", 
    "A way to do that, if you want to see a detailed view of the object, is to", 
    "stick these things into the Haml.", 
    "What that Haml notation is to be able to see details of an object.", 
    "That equal sign in Haml tells it to execute the code and", 
    "replace it with a value.", 
    "And then, as I said, what's nice about the log is, you can write things in.", 
    "This is--", 
    "[INAUDIBLE]", 
    "get to use it in production.", 
    "You can write things into the log, and that information will", 
    "be there a lot later.", 
    "So, that's a really good way.", 
    "And the print-- or printf from the old, good old C and", 
    "Java things, it just--", 
    "you can't use it in production and it's hard to find.", 
    "OK.", 
    "We talked about search, that's the R, A, and S part of it.", 
    "And you can do the Google it and there's a lot of documentation on", 
    "[INAUDIBLE].", 
    "Because Ruby is such a popular system, and somehow they have a lot of", 
    "advocates for it, there's a lot of resources, both videos and pages, that", 
    "are available there, as well as StackOverflow.", 
    "OK", 
    "With that, we will try the first question here.", 
    "So, here are the questions.", 
    "If you use puts or printf to print debugging messages in a production", 
    "app, what's going to happen?", 
    "Your app will raise an exception and grind to a halt.", 
    "Your app will continue, but the messages will be lost forever.", 
    "Your app will continue, and the message will go to log file.", 
    "The SaaS gods will strike you down in a fit of rage.", 
    "You'll be struck dead if you use the printf."
