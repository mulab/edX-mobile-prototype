    "Welcome to the second lecture.", 
    "Today we're going to talk about a couple of more things", 
    "out of Chapter 1.", 
    "Service-oriented architecture and cloud computing are two pretty big", 
    "forces that are transforming the software and hardware industry.", 
    "We're going to leap ahead in the book to talk about pair programming.", 
    "Because the plan was to give you a chance, guys, to do pair programming", 
    "earlier because the class last time thought it would be a good idea,", 
    "especially as you're learning Ruby, to do it in pairs.", 
    "And then, we'll give you the first two pieces of this really great language", 
    "called, Ruby.", 
    "All right, so service-oriented architecture.", 
    "So, this is an idea.", 
    "It's a pretty simple idea.", 
    "Interestingly, what happens sometimes in computer science is sometimes you", 
    "express an idea and everybody kind of gets it and they basically agree to", 
    "the same thing, what it means, and progress is made.", 
    "There's other times you come up with an acronym and it's so inclusive that", 
    "everybody means different things by it.", 
    "So this term, service-oriented architecture, almost died, even though", 
    "it had technical benefits because lots of different people had termed it", 
    "different ways.", 
    "And it seemed like with just marketing things like a", 
    "modular didn't mean anything.", 
    "But it actually does mean something and there's a fun story that's talking", 
    "about it here.", 
    "So service-oriented architecture means every single software component is an", 
    "independent component that you could logically connect to it as if it ran", 
    "on its own server.", 
    "And what that means, well, if you build an app that way it's got these", 
    "individual components.", 
    "It makes it really easy to reassemble the components and make a new app.", 
    "It also makes it really easy if you've built a bad architecture and you're", 
    "getting feedback from your customer that it's not working", 
    "the way they want.", 
    "It's really easy to reconfigure and put it together.", 
    "So we had to come up with a name.", 
    "Software-oriented architecture [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "is the name for something that's not software-oriented architecture, and so", 
    "we use the word software silo and have our little farm icon there", 
    "to talk about it.", 
    "So this idea is a monolithic piece of software.", 
    "All the components are behind a wall.", 
    "They all interact with each other.", 
    "So siloed software verses service-oriented architecture is the", 
    "two ideas here.", 
    "So how do we explain that?", 
    "Well, it turned out there is this blogger at Google who", 
    "used to work at Amazon.", 
    "And what this blogger did was that he would have two blogs.", 
    "He'd have the internal blog.", 
    "And often, once you start working at a big company, oh, your company is so", 
    "screwed up.", 
    "It's doing all these things wrong so you have this internal blog where you", 
    "point out how mistaken the company is and what it has to do", 
    "to get its act together.", 
    "And he also had this blog that he commented about IT in general.", 
    "Alas, this was this thing about-- he was probably multitasking.", 
    "He's probably looking at his phone and then he entered his blog.", 
    "Alas, his rant about why Google was screwed up, he put on the public blog.", 
    "And then, he probably sent one of his nicest blogs to everybody else, how", 
    "nice the technology was.", 
    "So, Armando saw that and was pretty sure that that blog wasn't going to", 
    "last very long, the public one, so he made a copy of it.", 
    "But it happens to be the best explanation of what software-oriented", 
    "architecture is and why, actually, for all of Google's strengths, Amazon and", 
    "Facebook really do do SOA software-oriented architecture, but", 
    "they don't.", 
    "Now, this person, this blogger at Google, who used to work at Amazon,", 
    "[INAUDIBLE]", 
    "this is [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "it's not really, the CEO of Amazon, really wouldn't say it.", 
    "You'll have to figure this out, it's Jeff Bezos, wouldn't really say that.", 
    "Now, Bezos is a really smart guy.", 
    "He graduated from Princeton.", 
    "He graduated with a degree in computer science from Princeton, and he went on", 
    "to found Amazon.", 
    "Amazon was founded in 1995.", 
    "But he sent this email seven years later about trying to get them to", 
    "switch to service-oriented architecture.", 
    "OK, so this is more or less a quote, right?", 
    "Edict, you come into work.", 
    "You open up your email.", 
    "Here's an email from the CEO.", 
    "\"All teams henceforth will expose their data and functionality through", 
    "service interfaces.\" So this is not in the silo but beyond", 
    "the wall of the silo.", 
    "\"Teams must communicate through there.", 
    "I think I can try my new gadget here.", 
    "Teams must, must, communicate with each other.", 
    "That's very valuable, \"must communicate with each other through", 
    "these interfaces.\" No other form of inter-process communication.", 
    "You can't.", 
    "No direct linking, no shared memory, no back doors, only via service calls.", 
    "Only through API's is what he's talking about.", 
    "Now, he doesn't care which protocol you use.", 
    "He's not going to say, we're all going to use SOC protocol or", 
    "something like that.", 
    "You guys figure that out.", 
    "I don't care.", 
    "Just use external protocol.", 
    "So when you do a service, it has to be designed from the ground up to be", 
    "externalize-able.", 
    "\"That is to say, the team must plan and design to expose these interfaces", 
    "to developers outside the world.", 
    "No exceptions.\"", 
    "So you're an engineer at Amazon.", 
    "Bezos maybe got his computer science degree but it's one of those oh, what", 
    "does he know?", 
    "I know better than him.", 
    "This'll be too slow.", 
    "He'll complain about performance.", 
    "I'm just going to ignore it.", 
    "So how did Bezos as a CEO fix that?", 
    "Make sure you get everybody's attention.", 
    "\"Anybody who doesn't do this will be fired.\" That probably", 
    "got everybody's attention.", 
    "And then, the final thing.", 
    "\"Thank you; have a nice day!' So what's the one thing he", 
    "didn't really write?", 
    "The last thing.", 
    "He wouldn't have said have a nice day.", 
    "The email ended, if you don't do this, you're fired.", 
    "So that actually did get all the engineers in Amazon to throw away", 
    "their software, start making externalized interface, and", 
    "everything's built with SOA.", 
    "Now, this Facebook, if you guys saw the movie, Facebook wasn't started", 
    "that long ago.", 
    "Three years after it was founded, they did the same thing.", 
    "They went from monolithic siloed software to this platform oriented", 
    "service-oriented architecture.", 
    "And in fact, I think it was called Google Platform.", 
    "Sorry, Facebook Platform.", 
    "And so one day you're reading the New York Times, maybe online, and suddenly", 
    "you're really seeing what articles your friends are reading too.", 
    "That was because they had this service-oriented architecture and it's", 
    "easy to plug lots of things into it.", 
    "And the guy who was doing this rant at Google was saying boy, Google's a", 
    "great company, really great software practices, but they just don't get the", 
    "service-oriented architecture.", 
    "He was complaining about Google Groups as his example because it's", 
    "Facebook-like.", 
    "And Google Groups, they didn't have a service-oriented architecture.", 
    "So there really wasn't anything you could do with that big pile of", 
    "software except for follow what other people were doing.", 
    "You could watch everything somebody else did, and he referred this as the", 
    "stalker options.", 
    "They had the stalker option so you could stalk people on Google which, I", 
    "guess, wasn't his favorite app.", 
    "So, let's do an example that's a little bit more concrete.", 
    "The idea, we're going to do a siloed version and a service-oriented", 
    "architecture version of Bookstore.", 
    "So in this siloed version, you have a bookstore service and you build", 
    "everything inside.", 
    "And all these things can share data and collect together", 
    "so you see the reviews.", 
    "The thing that's doing the reviews can access the review system, naturally", 
    "enough, and the users can interact.", 
    "You have to interact the users in the user profile, and all these pieces can", 
    "interact together.", 
    "They're well connected together.", 
    "And because it's behind the wall, you can really easily do this fast.", 
    "You can share memory so it runs really well.", 
    "And the only interface to this is the single API from the user on the", 
    "outside to this bookstore service.", 
    "That's this wall, is the API.", 
    "So what would a service-oriented architecture version", 
    "of this look like?", 
    "Now, these services in these little boxes here are supposed to be", 
    "independent servers that interact.", 
    "This is all via an external API.", 
    "And so you took the effort to build these three things, and then you built", 
    "the same bookstore service.", 
    "So what?", 
    "Well, it's really easy to build other services.", 
    "Suppose what you decide to do is have a favorite book service where you'd", 
    "interact with your friends.", 
    "And this would be hey, there's my favorite books if", 
    "you want to buy these.", 
    "And then, maybe before it could only handle, let's say, eBay or the Paypal,", 
    "but you want to add credit card processing, there's another interface", 
    "you could pull in.", 
    "So if you pay the effort, the extra performance efforts of going through", 
    "those external API's, you can reassemble these things together.", 
    "So that's an example there.", 
    "So we're trying to find out which is false, which is not true.", 
    "I'll read the options.", 
    "The first option, service-oriented architecture does not affect", 
    "performance.", 
    "The siloed systems are likely completely down on a failure.", 
    "Service-oriented architecture must deal with partial failures that some", 
    "components are working and some aren't.", 
    "That's harder.", 
    "Ideally, the whole thing fails but if it's partially failing, it's harder.", 
    "SOA improves developer productivity primarily through reuse, and no", 
    "services can name or access another services data.", 
    "You can only make requests for data through an external API.", 
    "That is for SOA.", 
    "So what's false there?"
