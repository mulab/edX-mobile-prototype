    "DAN KLEIN: So, today...", 
    "Again, welcome to CS188.", 
    "Today what we'll be doing is talking about what artificial", 
    "intelligence actually is.", 
    "You just signed up for a course for it.", 
    "What are you going to get?", 
    "We're going to talk about what AI can actually do today.", 
    "And then I'll give a little overview about what you can", 
    "expect to learn from this course.", 
    "First, let's think about the dream.", 
    "Let's think about what our popular culture has depicted", 
    "artificial intelligence as in the movies over time.", 
    "So it's possible you've seen some of these movies.", 
    "Does anybody recognize this?", 
    "So who's this?", 
    "Who's the tall yellow one?", 
    "That's C-3PO.", 
    "What does C-3PO do?", 
    "C-3PO is a protocol droid, human-cyborg relations, right?", 
    "So basically a machine translator.", 
    "He's basically Google Translate with anxiety, right?", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "DAN KLEIN: OK, how about R2-D2?", 
    "What does he do?", 
    "Yeah, I have no idea what he does, actually.", 
    "But the point is, both of them, they're helpful, they're", 
    "well-meaning, they're good, right?", 
    "And it's a very positive view on what technology can bring.", 
    "This was the '70s.", 
    "Things kind of got darker in our popular culture view of", 
    "technology.", 
    "And this goes through a wide range of", 
    "genres, not just movies.", 
    "And so we started worrying.", 
    "Wait a minute, maybe the robots won't translate for us", 
    "and beep around.", 
    "Maybe there's going to be killer hardware from the", 
    "future coming back to kill us.", 
    "It's a very different view, right?", 
    "And they kind of look the same.", 
    "Well, maybe not.", 
    "But it's a different view of the future.", 
    "It's very scary, right?", 
    "The scary hardware coming back, really with malice.", 
    "We're now a little bit afraid of the technology.", 
    "That was the '80s.", 
    "What about the '90s?", 
    "In the '90s we learned that, actually, software is scary.", 
    "And then what's happened since then?", 
    "Well, since then, we've thought of a lot of ideas but", 
    "really the basic fear of what technology might do if it goes", 
    "wrong hasn't gone away.", 
    "Now we worry about things like, what if the evil", 
    "technology turns on us and maybe actually we can't even", 
    "tell us apart from them?", 
    "or maybe the technology won't just look like us, maybe", 
    "instead the technology will be evil and really snarky.", 
    "And so we're not really sure what we're afraid of.", 
    "But kind of we know we're afraid.", 
    "There are exceptions like WALL-E that have a somewhat", 
    "uplifting view what technology might bring, at least after we", 
    "destroy ourselves.", 
    "But by and large, there's this thread of worrying about what", 
    "AI might do.", 
    "OK, that's the science fiction story.", 
    "That's the worry.", 
    "Let's talk about what AI actually is.", 
    "In particular, I'm not very worried about", 
    "these things at present.", 
    "So what is AI?", 
    "Well, actually, this is a big discussion we have", 
    "to have as a field.", 
    "What is AI?", 
    "Well, we're going to be building machines, software", 
    "that does something.", 
    "What's our goal?", 
    "What does it mean to build an artificial intelligence?", 
    "Well, there have been multiple schools of thought on this.", 
    "One school of thought is what we should really be doing is", 
    "building machines to think like people.", 
    "Intelligence is about thinking, and this is", 
    "artificial.", 
    "What's the natural intelligence?", 
    "I guess that's us.", 
    "So we want to build these machines that somehow go", 
    "through the thinking processes that people do.", 
    "All right, there is actually a science that studies this.", 
    "And it's not really AI anymore.", 
    "This is some mix of cognitive science and computational", 
    "neuroscience really trying to understand the brain.", 
    "And its very important, but it's not what this course is", 
    "going to be about.", 
    "So another thing that people at times have thought AI", 
    "should be is: we should be building machines that act", 
    "like people.", 
    "OK, so we should say, who cares about how they think?", 
    "They can think in some strange, alien, silicon way.", 
    "But the action, the behavior, has to be like what we know", 
    "from people.", 
    "This was actually a very early definition.", 
    "This is straight from Alan Turing, the definition that", 
    "really all you can do is check behavior.", 
    "Is the behavior like an intelligent human?", 
    "And so this led to ideas.", 
    "How many of you have heard of the Turing test?", 
    "So this led to things like the Turing test, where you put a", 
    "robot on one chat channel and a human on the other.", 
    "And then you have an interrogator who chats with", 
    "both of them and tries to say that one was the robot and", 
    "that one was the human.", 
    "And this is a really good idea.", 
    "Because provided you can't actually see them, like if", 
    "there's no video, or you know the robot's the one with the", 
    "blinking lights.", 
    "So provided it's just over chat, you can really kind of", 
    "test anything.", 
    "It's open-ended.", 
    "Do they have hobbies?", 
    "Can they answer a general question about a chess", 
    "configuration?", 
    "The problem was, the Turing test, in order to really do", 
    "well, you don't just really concentrate on programming", 
    "intelligence, you concentrate on things like don't spell too", 
    "well, humans don't do that.", 
    "So you build in some typo machines.", 
    "And then you think, oh, wait a minute, if I get asked about", 
    "the square root of 35, I better not have an answer.", 
    "And so you go through basically trying to mimic", 
    "things that probably you didn't really value in the", 
    "human in the first place.", 
    "On the other hand, you've got to be really sure that you", 
    "have a favorite Shakespeare play because the interrogator", 
    "always asks that.", 
    "So that's thinking like people and acting like people.", 
    "And the realization was, this really wasn't going anywhere", 
    "in terms of building machines that were", 
    "useful in, say, industry.", 
    "And so the realization was maybe it's not", 
    "about mimicking people.", 
    "We've already got those.", 
    "Maybe we should do something else.", 
    "Maybe what we should be doing is building machines that", 
    "think rationally.", 
    "So whatever the thought processes are,", 
    "they should be correct.", 
    "Well, what does it mean to have a", 
    "correct thought process?", 
    "That's a very kind of prescriptive thing.", 
    "And this actually has a long history in the logicist and", 
    "philosophy tradition, going all the way backstage, say, to", 
    "Aristotle's laws of thought.", 
    "This is how you think in order to kind of not make a mistake", 
    "in your deductions.", 
    "And this tradition actually still shows up in various", 
    "places of AI.", 
    "By and large, this wasn't the winner.", 
    "And the reason it wasn't the winner is because our ability", 
    "to write down how to do logical deduction turned out", 
    "to be relatively fragile.", 
    "And in any case, when we were learning about how to", 
    "incorporate uncertainty, we also had this realization that", 
    "really it wasn't about how you think, but about the actions", 
    "you take in the end.", 
    "So the winner for this course, is AI, for us, is the science", 
    "of making machines that act rationally.", 
    "So what's that mean?", 
    "We only care about what they do.", 
    "And our requirement on what they do is that they achieve", 
    "their goals optimally.", 
    "So you may be looking at this, and you may be", 
    "thinking, OK, rational.", 
    "Rational means I have a level-headed", 
    "decision, I don't get angry.", 
    "So we want to build machines that don't get angry.", 
    "Well, I don't know, if you think back to GLaDOS, maybe", 
    "that's good.", 
    "Maybe we shouldn't build machines that get angry.", 
    "Skynet got a little angry.", 
    "So maybe we shouldn't build machines that get angry.", 
    "But when we say rational, that's not what we mean.", 
    "Rational has a very technical meaning.", 
    "It means that you maximally achieve your predefined goals.", 
    "So the input to an AI is a goal.", 
    "And then rationality means you achieve it in the best", 
    "possible way.", 
    "In rationality, it only matters what you do.", 
    "It doesn't matter the thought process you go through.", 
    "If I have a robot vacuum cleaner, and it just makes", 
    "some optimal grid on the ground, and cleans up all the", 
    "dirt, great.", 
    "If it sits in the corner and thinks, all right,", 
    "where shall I clean?", 
    "Well, if I go diagonally there will be a place left over, and", 
    "then it cleans everything up, fine.", 
    "It doesn't matter.", 
    "They're equally rational for that task in that context.", 
    "There may be advantages to the thinking robot.", 
    "There may be advantages to the kind of more", 
    "reactive reflex robot.", 
    "We'll talk about that in the next class.", 
    "Goals are all expressed through utilities.", 
    "So we're going to spend a lot of time in this course talking", 
    "about what a utility is.", 
    "And in the end, remember that being rational means", 
    "maximizing your expected utility.", 
    "So this course, really, we should have called it", 
    "Computational Rationality.", 
    "We're going to teach you computational methods.", 
    "This is a computer science course.", 
    "An it's going to all be about this idea of rationality,", 
    "maximally achieving your goals.", 
    "OK, you say what about artificial?", 
    "I didn't really say anything about artificiality, that's", 
    "kind of orthogonal.", 
    "And what about intelligence?", 
    "Well, intelligence was a tricky thing.", 
    "The philosophers are still working on that.", 
    "When they get back to us on what intelligence is, well,", 
    "probably we'll just ask them then what consciousness is.", 
    "But when they get back to us on intelligence, we're going", 
    "to say, that's great, but we're working on", 
    "rationality right now.", 
    "So if you remember nothing else in the course or if you", 
    "decide you really want an AI tattoo and you needed to", 
    "distill this entire course down to one", 
    "thing it would be this.", 
    "It would be maximize your expected utility.", 
    "And we're going to spend this entire course thinking about", 
    "computational systems that do this.", 
    "And in order to do that, we've got however many weeks left in", 
    "which we will unpack this definition.", 
    "The first part of the course deals with the maximize.", 
    "How do I figure out which action is best?", 
    "That has to do with the consequences of that action,", 
    "the context of that action.", 
    "Are there adversaries?", 
    "We're then going to have to unpack this idea of utility.", 
    "What is a utility?", 
    "What does it mean to have a function that", 
    "describes my goals?", 
    "And then, kind of the kicker in here that's a little bit", 
    "hidden, is what is this deal about expectation?", 
    "Well, if I take an action and I don't know", 
    "what's going to happen.", 
    "So my optimization of goals rationally doesn't deal with", 
    "being successful.", 
    "Life is full of risks.", 
    "It has to do with doing the right thing in kind of the", 
    "appropriate kind of weighted average.", 
    "And so we're going to have to unpack this notion of what it", 
    "means to do the right thing on average.", 
    "And that will get us into probabilistic inference.", 
    "And that will occupy the middle third of the course.", 
    "So you say what about the brain?", 
    "I mean we're engineers, right?", 
    "We want to build something.", 
    "We want to build something that's intelligent.", 
    "It would be a little silly to ignore the fact that we", 
    "actually have a working prototype and we're trying to", 
    "do this really hard thing.", 
    "We should look at the prototype.", 
    "And human minds are not perfect decision makers.", 
    "But by and large, they're actually very good.", 
    "And even the cases where humans are famously not", 
    "rational, there are many cases there where you can actually", 
    "say, well they are rational if you think of their goals in a", 
    "different way.", 
    "That's the whole sticky subject.", 
    "We'll talk about that later in the course.", 
    "But basically, human brains are, in many ways, better than", 
    "what we can build.", 
    "So let's just reverse engineer them.", 
    "So it turns out brains aren't as modular as software and", 
    "they're a whole lot more squishy.", 
    "And so they're hard to reverse engineer.", 
    "And because we can't reverse engineer them and we have a", 
    "very limited understanding of what our brains actually do,", 
    "we really don't kind of reverse engineer them and", 
    "build a kind of biomimetic brain.", 
    "And in particular, there is an idea, this is one point of", 
    "view, but I think it's got a lot of merit to it.", 
    "People say that brains are to intelligence as", 
    "wings are to flight.", 
    "And that is to say, that the biggest breakthrough in manned", 
    "flight, does anybody know what was the biggest breakthrough", 
    "in manned flight?", 
    "Well, no, the wings are actually kind of important.", 
    "It's stop making the wings flap.", 
    "Stop trying to make a really big bird made out of metal or", 
    "something, or fabric.", 
    "And so this idea of, OK, maybe the wings can be fixed because", 
    "we're going to be going faster, we're going to be", 
    "going higher, it's going to be rigid.", 
    "And so when people started thinking, OK, we're going to", 
    "learn about aerodynamics from the proofs of concept, say,", 
    "the birds, but we're not going to just slavishly mimic what's", 
    "in the biology.", 
    "Same thing with the brains.", 
    "We're going to learn what we can.", 
    "But we're not going to just mimic that because we've got", 
    "different constraints and a limited understanding of what", 
    "the brain does to begin with.", 
    "So what do we actually get?", 
    "Well we do know something from the brain.", 
    "And it boils down to this at kind of the", 
    "very highest level.", 
    "That we know that in order to make good decisions there's", 
    "really two parts to that.", 
    "One part of that, one way you can make a good decision, is", 
    "by remembering that in the past you did this", 
    "thing and it was bad.", 
    "So you know not to do that thing again.", 
    "That boils down to memory.", 
    "That leads into learning, machine learning, and that's", 
    "going to be a big part of this course.", 
    "The other way you can make a good prediction is through", 
    "simulation, having a model of the world.", 
    "Where you think, all right, what would", 
    "happen if I do this?", 
    "Well, then this would happen, then this would happen.", 
    "Oh, and then that would happen, that would be bad.", 
    "And so you can realize that something's a bad decision by", 
    "thinking through a chain of consequences, not actually", 
    "doing that chain, but thinking it through in a simulated", 
    "model of the world.", 
    "And that's going to occupy the first half of the class, when", 
    "we think about what it means to have a model of the world", 
    "that's an abstraction of the world and what it means to", 
    "think ahead along a kind of tree of outcomes."
