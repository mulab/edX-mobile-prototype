<h2>Homework 2: Introduction to Rails</h2><p>In this homework you will clone a GitHub repository ("repo") containing an existing Rails app called "RottenPotatoes", add
a feature to the app, and deploy the result publicly on the Heroku platform. We will run live
integration tests against your deployed version.
</p><p><b><i>General advice</i></b></p><p>This homework involves modifying RottenPotatoes in various ways. Git (version control) is
your friend. <i>Commit frequently</i> in case you inadvertently break something that was working
before! This way, you can always back up to an earlier revision and/or easily compare what
changed in each file since your last "good" commit.
</p><b><i>Important for grading purposes</i></b><ul><li>Do not use JavaScript to implement any of the functionality required for this homework.</li></ul><p>
For each part of this homework, you will submit a text file containing a single line with the url of your Heroku deployment. The url will look like this:
<code>http://your-app-name.herokuapp.com</code><br/></p>
