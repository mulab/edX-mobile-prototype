       <p> Welcome to CS169.1x: Software Engineering for Software as a Service! </p>

<br><p>You can check out the 
<a href="syllabus/">syllabus page</a> 
to see the topics we&#8217;ll be covering. You will learn the principles of software engineering by developing software to be deployed as a service in the cloud. Rather than just advise on good practices, this course offers software tools to put each of those practices to work. There will be lecture videos and homework assignments or programming assignments nearly every week, and quizzes every two weeks. <br></p>
<p>
The course information page has information about course logistics and policies. Our primary communication channel will be our interactive forum, where we&#8217;ll all contribute to an ongoing discussion of the material. <br></p>

<p>There are a couple videos for you to watch on the courseware page: an official welcome to the course by us and tutorial videos walking you through the edX platform. The first lecture segments will be available for you to watch on Monday. In these introductory segments, we give the history of software (including some infamous disasters) and how it led to the Agile software development method, which we teach and which many SaaS companies use.
</p>

<p>We will post a mini-quiz, Quiz 0, that will serve as a course self-diagnostic so you can verify your programming preparedness for the course as well as your understanding of the goals of this course.<br></p>
<p>We look forward to participating in a grand learning experiment with you!
