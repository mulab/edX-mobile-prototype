  <p> “Patrons can make donations as well as buy tickets.  For donations we need to track which fund they donate to so we can create reports showing each fund’s activity.  For tickets we need to track what show they’re for so we can run reports by show, plus other things that aren’t true of donations, such as when they expire.”
