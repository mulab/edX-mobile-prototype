<h1>Part 2</h1><h3>Due Sunday, December 2nd</h3><br/><h2>3. Fixing a bug in Typo</h2><p>The version of typo you have checked out contains a bug that prevents categories from being
  created or edited. To see this bug, make sure you are logged in as an administrator and click on 
  the "categories" link on the left hand side of the admin page. The page is intended to look as follows:</p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/wsHFZG4Jf2yYwsyOIJfEk5JT0aaKnRU_WG_YvMunRL_8uEXdh8QSxINNVbl27WVUBmZxg3yR1Kx_sO5FULzLTMAVJApuDypM_ds84PU20tx7"/><p>This page is intended to allow you to add and edit blogging categories. Fix this bug by writing 
  cucumber tests that fail when this bug is present and pass when you can successfully edit 
  existing categories and create new categories.</p><br/><b>Congratulations! You are all done with the legacy code assignment.</b>
