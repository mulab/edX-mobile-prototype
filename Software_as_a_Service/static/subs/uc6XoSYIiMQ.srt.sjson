    "ARMANDO FOX: OK.", 
    "So reflecting forwards and backwards a little bit.", 
    "In terms of just technologies that we've talked about--", 
    "and every time we teach this class, it has to change because the technologies", 
    "move so fast--", 
    "but we can kind of look forward a little bit and say, what are some", 
    "things that we learned this time around and how might they be different", 
    "if you revisited this in a couple of years?", 
    "One of the big areas that's changing really rapidly is JavaScript.", 
    "And every time we teach the class, the way we handle JavaScript changes.", 
    "Someday it may settle down, but I think one thing to keep track of going", 
    "forward, and something we haven't really done in this class, is what", 
    "people call single page apps.", 
    "Google Maps is probably a good example.", 
    "You sort of load one page and once you've loaded that particular page,", 
    "all of the other interaction takes place via Ajax.", 
    "You never do a full page reload for anything.", 
    "That's kind of the direction a lot of apps are heading.", 
    "And at least you've learned the basic ingredients on how to do that.", 
    "If you structure your app as having service oriented RESTful APIs, you're", 
    "already in a position to do this kind of work.", 
    "Yes, you're going to have to do a lot more JavaScript coding but the", 
    "important thing is thinking about the app as serving a bunch of content,", 
    "whether it's to JavaScript or whether it's to a web browser that's just", 
    "going to render as an HTML page.", 
    "So when you structure your app that way, it turns out it's pretty easy to", 
    "put a kind of conventional HTML front end on it.", 
    "And that's why we kept, during the course, coming back to the idea of", 
    "service-oriented architecture, clean RESTful APIs.", 
    "If you start from that, you can get to any of the other two endpoints.", 
    "But if you don't start from that, it can be very awkward to try to retrofit", 
    "a nice Ajax front end onto your app.", 
    "Another thing we didn't really talk much about is mobile applications.", 
    "But mobile applications really are a special case of client server where", 
    "the client is constrained by being on a handheld device of some kind.", 
    "Now that used to mean that it had really wimpy computational", 
    "capabilities compared to your laptop.", 
    "That's less true than it was, but it certainly has different affordances.", 
    "Right?", 
    "The screens are smaller, usually you have a touch interface.", 
    "It's awkward to type long sentences.", 
    "But again, you know the raw ingredients of using things like", 
    "cascading style sheets, auto completion with Ajax, the kind of", 
    "things that could help a user on a mobile app, even if the app wasn't", 
    "originally designed with mobile in mind, you know how to put a mobile", 
    "front end on it.", 
    "In some sense, it's almost another special case of putting a different", 
    "front end on the application given that you're starting from a", 
    "service-oriented architecture.", 
    "And in terms of writing, you could learn iOS.", 
    "You could learn Android, or if it were me, I would look for the opportunity", 
    "to do my application in JavaScript and HTML5.", 
    "And there's freeware that will wrap an HTML5 JavaScript app and then you can", 
    "put it on Android or put it on the iPhone.", 
    "If you try that, and if your app really has performance needs that go", 
    "beyond what JavaScript can do on those devices, then God bless you.", 
    "Go learn iOS.", 
    "But don't assume that that's the first step.", 
    "The standards are now good enough.", 
    "Support for JavaScript is pervasive.", 
    "Phones have gotten pretty fast.", 
    "You might be surprised how far you can go.", 
    "And if you're trying to do a new app or a new product, how quickly you can", 
    "prototype something compelling is actually really important.", 
    "So I think my advice if you're thinking of going into the mobile app", 
    "world, is at least consider the path of prototyping it that way first.", 
    "And if it turns out to be too slow, then you have the option of OK, we're", 
    "going to move parts of that app selectively starting into native code", 
    "like iOS or Java Android code.", 
    "In terms of looking backwards, we've actually done a lot.", 
    "We started with this flowchart that represents a typical iteration in", 
    "doing Agile design.", 
    "And we've covered a lot of concepts on the way.", 
    "You've learned how to deal with legacy code.", 
    "Some people had to do it in their projects, which I thought was great.", 
    "You've learned how to work with external customers who, for the most", 
    "part, are non-technical, and translate what their needs are into something", 
    "that is buildable and designable and that you can plan your development", 
    "time around.", 
    "You've learned how to track what you're doing and see whether the", 
    "amount you thought you would get done this week is actually what you got", 
    "done this week.", 
    "And deployment.", 
    "It's not real unless the customer gets to use it and deploy it.", 
    "So if you think about what you've done, it's an enormous amount.", 
    "And you did all of it really before starting on the projects.", 
    "So the course goes really fast.", 
    "We've always been impressed by the quality of the projects.", 
    "And based on the previews that we saw, I think this time is", 
    "going to be no exception.", 
    "So give yourselves a pat on the back.", 
    "You guys have actually mastered a lot of material.", 
    "And I think some people have already found that when you're interviewing", 
    "for software jobs, recruiters notice this.", 
    "A lot of this is essential to the way that software's designed today, which", 
    "shouldn't be surprising because how did we even come", 
    "up with this material?", 
    "We did a survey of a half dozen companies that you've heard of, all of", 
    "whom are considered software leaders.", 
    "And we asked them, what's missing from software engineering?", 
    "You're recruiting students from one of the best CS programs in the country,", 
    "if not the best.", 
    "And what is it that you wish that they were better at?", 
    "And nobody said that we wish they were better at coding.", 
    "Everybody said they're great programmers but they don't know how to", 
    "deal with legacy code that they didn't write.", 
    "They don't know enough about testing and why testing is as important or", 
    "more important than development of new code.", 
    "They haven't had much experience working with a customer who's not", 
    "technical and with whom they can't converse in technical terms about what", 
    "the project is going to be about.", 
    "And part of that is design reviews and small teams.", 
    "So you guys have done all that.", 
    "Of course, it's not the same as if you had done it in production code in a", 
    "real company, but it's surprisingly close.", 
    "The difference between what you've done in this course and what you would", 
    "be doing at a leading software company, is really one of degree and", 
    "not one of kind.", 
    "So you should feel proud of yourselves for what you guys have gone through.", 
    "It's an enormous amount of stuff.", 
    "Topically, if you remember nothing else conceptually from the course,", 
    "here are some things that I hope you take away from it, even if you never", 
    "touch Ruby again, even if you never deploy another Rails app, even if you", 
    "don't do software as a service.", 
    "These are really important concepts.", 
    "And we picked Ruby and Rails because we thought they would be the best way", 
    "to illustrate the concepts in action in multiple different ways.", 
    "The first big one is reusability.", 
    "And ironically, don't repeat yourself and reusing go hand in hand.", 
    "Reusing is not repetition.", 
    "Reusing is taking the same thing and plugging it into different places.", 
    "That's a good thing and that sort of the holy grail of software", 
    "engineering.", 
    "So we've tried to show a few different ways, both at the architecture level", 
    "with things like design patterns and how you do refactoring, and also at", 
    "the language level.", 
    "The fact that Ruby supports a limited version of things like aspects lets", 
    "you dry out things like validations and filters.", 
    "That's an illustration of a good strategy for", 
    "drying out those concepts.", 
    "It doesn't mean you can do it in every language, but when you find yourself", 
    "facing a different language and framework, you'll think of these ideas", 
    "and say, how can I get a similar effect?", 
    "How could I factor out that part of the code so that I could reuse that", 
    "functionality in other places without cutting and pasting?", 
    "Testability- as you may have guessed, I'm a big fan of testing.", 
    "One of the reasons I'm a big fan is because I have had production", 
    "applications fail because of stupid tests that I failed to write.", 
    "I've had stupid failure modes that made customers mad.", 
    "And until you have that, you won't kick yourself in the head and say, why", 
    "didn't I work on testing more.", 
    "I'm hoping none of you actually have that before the demo.", 
    "But the test abilities stuff really comes from the heart.", 
    "I wouldn't be teaching any of that stuff if I had not", 
    "felt the pain myself.", 
    "So to that end, we tried to pick a really good testing framework to show", 
    "you why stubs and mocks are important, how to think about testing a small", 
    "piece of code in isolation of the things that it depends on.", 
    "And again, you may find yourself in a project where the language and the", 
    "tools don't support it as well, but at least you'll be inspired.", 
    "What happened with JavaScript is the testing tools weren't as good and the", 
    "folks at Pivotal created Jasmine because they wanted a testing", 
    "experience in JavaScript that was as good as what they had gotten used to", 
    "with RSpec.", 
    "So that's the kind of thinking we're trying to foster.", 
    "You can build stuff yourself, if you know what you're aiming for.", 
    "And lastly, as I mentioned, none of the companies who hire our students", 
    "have complained about their programming skills, but software", 
    "engineering is not just programming.", 
    "Development is a process and it has a lot of moving parts.", 
    "Some of which are the customer, which can be difficult to deal with.", 
    "Some of which are how you coordinate with your team so that you can work", 
    "together without sort of stepping on each other's toes.", 
    "So those are things that we've tried to at least capture in microcosm in", 
    "the project.", 
    "That's why the projects are structured the way they are and why we think it's", 
    "so great that you're working with real customers rather than kind of building", 
    "something you want.", 
    "When you want to build something, you already have a sense of how you're", 
    "going to build it.", 
    "The customer knows what they want but they probably have no idea", 
    "how to build it.", 
    "And that's a really valuable skill for all of you to start developing.", 
    "So remember, software engineering, hacking is not the same as developing.", 
    "You might be doing a brand new start up and writing greenfield code but", 
    "that's not the typical case.", 
    "You'll probably be enhancing code that somebody else built before.", 
    "Working code is not finished.", 
    "This is one of the things we keep saying.", 
    "Refactoring and polishing, in some sense, is more important than the", 
    "first draft.", 
    "Why?", 
    "Because soon that code's going to be legacy and you're going to have to", 
    "enhance it, or some other poor schmuck is going to have to enhance it.", 
    "And when that time comes, the important thing about your code is", 
    "going to be, not just does it work, but is it easy enough to understand", 
    "that I can improve on it?", 
    "So that's why getting the code working is almost easier than", 
    "getting it to be elegant.", 
    "And that's why we focus so much on elegance.", 
    "Maintainability is what makes you a valuable software engineer.", 
    "And lastly, hopefully this has already been excised by our guest speakers but", 
    "just in case, if you're interviewing for a company and they say that what", 
    "they're looking for is JavaScript skills, go somewhere else.", 
    "A real software company is not looking for you to known a particular language", 
    "because you're agility as a software engineer is going to require you to be", 
    "learning new languages all the time.", 
    "I think what they do want to know is, do you understand how", 
    "to work with customers?", 
    "Do you understand how to think about testing a piece of software?", 
    "Do you understand what refactoring means and why it's important?", 
    "If you understand those things, you can translate those concepts into a", 
    "variety of languages.", 
    "And we did a survey of previous generations of 169 students and we", 
    "found that more than half of them were doing just that.", 
    "They ended up working in industry on projects that didn't use Ruby, didn't", 
    "use Rails, but they were using a surprising amount of the ideas that", 
    "came from the course and they had translated them", 
    "into the other framework.", 
    "So that's what's going to make us happy is if we survey you guys a year", 
    "from now, which we plan to do, and we find out that you're actually putting", 
    "this knowledge to work, even though the technologies you're using have", 
    "nothing to do with what we taught in the class.", 
    "So that's our summary of software engineering being more than", 
    "programming."
