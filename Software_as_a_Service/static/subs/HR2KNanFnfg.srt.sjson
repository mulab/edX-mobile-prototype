    "ARMANDO FOX: So let's go through these.", 
    "Some commits present at the remote are not present on your local repo.", 
    "That's basically exactly what a non-fast forward error is.", 
    "So that one's true.", 
    "And the implication is yes, in order to bring things into sync before you", 
    "can push more changes, you do need to do a merge and pull before you can", 
    "complete the push.", 
    "So the green one is true.", 
    "You need to manually fix merge conflicts in one or more files.", 
    "This is the one that is false, because in some cases, when you pull those new", 
    "commits, they can be applied without causing any merge conflicts.", 
    "In fact, in a well run, well organized project, that's more often", 
    "the case than not.", 
    "So the correct answer is red was false.", 
    "And your local repo is out of date with respect to the remote.", 
    "Yeah, it's because if your local repo is missing some commits that are", 
    "present to the remote, it means they must have gotten there since the last", 
    "time that you tried to sync with the remote.", 
    "OK?", 
    "So the correct answer was red.", 
    "Good job.", 
    "So let's take another step and sort of get power usage.", 
    "Now we're really getting into how a version control can particularly help", 
    "you if you're working on a team project.", 
    "So these are some features that, if you haven't worked on a team before,", 
    "you may not have ever used branching in version control systems.", 
    "But once you get the hang of it-- it's little intimidating at first, but once", 
    "you get the hang of it, it's exceedingly powerful.", 
    "And one of Git's major steps forward over earlier systems is that branching", 
    "is instantaneous and very easy to do.", 
    "So it encourages a style of project management where you create a lot of", 
    "short-lived branches in order to isolate your temporary changes to the", 
    "code, which might break stuff from the sort of stable code that everybody is", 
    "relying on.", 
    "So what's a branch?", 
    "Depending on your terminology, Subversion used to use the name", 
    "development trunk, because it believed that there was sort of one true path", 
    "of development and you could periodically branch off of it.", 
    "Git uses the term \"master\" to refer to the default branch that's created when", 
    "a project is first set up.", 
    "When you set up a new repo.", 
    "But the idea of whether the master branch represents the truth, or the", 
    "main line of development, in Git, that's a convention.", 
    "Teams choose whether to treat the master branch that way.", 
    "And as we'll see, with respect to questions like where do you release", 
    "from, where do you fix a bug, where do you do development of new features,", 
    "there's different approaches to this that you can take.", 
    "And the master branch doesn't necessarily play the same role in all", 
    "the scenarios.", 
    "So as with other changes in Git, it doesn't dictate that the master branch", 
    "is the main line of development.", 
    "Although in practice, a lot of people do use it that way in small projects.", 
    "Uniquely in Git, compared to earlier systems, creating a branch is cheap.", 
    "It's so cheap that the first time you do it, you might think it didn't work,", 
    "because it's literally instantaneous.", 
    "You type a command line, and with no wait, you've", 
    "created a brand new branch.", 
    "Which is pretty neat, because once you create a branch, any changes that you", 
    "make along that branch are completely separate from any changes that are", 
    "occurring along the branch that you branched off of.", 
    "Until and unless you later merge the changes in one direction or both", 
    "directions.", 
    "So it's kind of surprising from an implementation point of view that,", 
    "given that you're essentially maintaining completely separate commit", 
    "histories, how fast it is to create and manage a branch.", 
    "You can merge your branches back into the branch that they came from,", 
    "whether you call it the trunk or the master.", 
    "You can also maintain branches indefinitely as a separate, parallel", 
    "development alongside the main branch.", 
    "But as we'll see in most of the interesting use cases for branches,", 
    "most branches eventually die.", 
    "And in Agile development, they tend to die pretty fast.", 
    "And in fact, the killer use case--", 
    "if you don't use branches for anything else, use them for this--", 
    "is branch per feature.", 
    "So what's the idea here?", 
    "When you start working on a new feature, you as one member of a team", 
    "would like to start working on your feature without", 
    "disrupting working code.", 
    "Now, it used to be the way that you had to do this in systems like", 
    "Subversion is, you could create a branch, which is quite", 
    "expensive to do.", 
    "Or you could sort of do a lot of local development on your own machine.", 
    "But you couldn't commit things, because that would contaminate the", 
    "main code base.", 
    "So you could say, all right, well, I won't commit things.", 
    "I'll just do local development until I'm sure everything's", 
    "ready to check in.", 
    "But then, you can't use version control features for yourself.", 
    "If, during your development, you want to roll back to an earlier snapshot or", 
    "something, you can't do that.", 
    "So branch per feature solves a lot of these problems.", 
    "And the idea is really simple.", 
    "When you start working on a new feature, however trivial you think", 
    "that feature might be, create a new branch just for", 
    "working on that feature.", 
    "And now, remember, part of our mantra is programmers are always optimists.", 
    "We always think it'll be really simple.", 
    "Oh, this feature, five lines in that file, and add a line in my config", 
    "file, and I'll done, right?", 
    "If that happens to you one time during this semester, and you actually were", 
    "right about how easy it was, I will give you a piece of free schwag,", 
    "because I'm sure you're wrong.", 
    "We're always optimistic about this.", 
    "And I have learned the hard way that a branch per feature is the painless way", 
    "to deal with it.", 
    "And this branch might--", 
    "it might be the case that nobody else on your team ever sees this branch", 
    "except you.", 
    "And that's fine, because you're going to use it only for the changes needed", 
    "for this particular feature.", 
    "And once you're satisfied, you'll merge it back into the trunk or the", 
    "master, whatever you're going to call it.", 
    "A nice implication of this is that, if the brand was pretty short-lived, if", 
    "you decide that the feature isn't working out, you can back out the", 
    "feature by essentially undoing that merge.", 
    "And the idea is that if your app is really well factored, one feature", 
    "shouldn't touch that many parts of the app.", 
    "So the idea of backing out the merge is not a ridiculous idea.", 
    "This diagram is based on one in the book that actually shows, in a typical", 
    "development team, this master branch goes through the middle.", 
    "And Amy, Bob, and Dee are each going to work on three--", 
    "they're working on three different new features of the application.", 
    "So all of them create a branch off of master at the same point.", 
    "Amy does several commits on her own branch.", 
    "Remember, these are not visible at all on the master branch.", 
    "So this is just her checkpointing her own work.", 
    "And when she's satisfied with a feature and with her test coverage,", 
    "she will merge her branch back into the master.", 
    "So point C represents a merge commit.", 
    "It's the merge of whatever the master was at A and whatever Amy's most", 
    "recent commit is.", 
    "In the meantime, Bob has started working on a feature.", 
    "But he figured out halfway through that his feature wasn't going to work", 
    "out, or maybe the customer didn't want it.", 
    "So he just lets his branch die.", 
    "He deletes his branch without do anything for it.", 
    "Remember how we talked about mounting a scratch monkey.", 
    "This is a scratch branch.", 
    "And Dee has continued to work on her feature.", 
    "But by the time that she's ready to merge hers, notice that there's now", 
    "one commit that is present on the master that is", 
    "absent from Dee's branch.", 
    "So at the very least, she's going to have to do a pull before she can merge", 
    "her branch into the master.", 
    "And if Amy's features and Dee's feature are pretty separate, with any", 
    "luck, that merge is not going to cause any manual conflicts", 
    "that have to be resolved.", 
    "So in some cases, the branches that are created for these features will", 
    "never leave those people's machines.", 
    "In other cases, they'll actually be able to push the branch that they have", 
    "a backup of it, and they can do everything that they could have done", 
    "with a master branch.", 
    "So one of the things about Agile development that makes this work well", 
    "is because our features tend to be in terms of user stories.", 
    "They're pretty tightly circumscribed.", 
    "The length of time from branching off of the master to deciding your feature", 
    "is done and your merging your branch in, most of the time, would be one", 
    "iteration, right?", 
    "If the branch is basically handling one user story.", 
    "And that's good, because you can imagine that--", 
    "imagine that we had several other people doing branches.", 
    "By the time the seventh or eighth person gets out here, they're going to", 
    "have a lot of merging to do before they can push their changes back into", 
    "the code base.", 
    "So having long-lived branches makes them more difficult to manage, because", 
    "they can get farther and farther out of sync with the thing that you want", 
    "to merge them back into.", 
    "OK, so mechanics.", 
    "How do you actually go about doing this?", 
    "You start by creating a new branch and switching to it.", 
    "So you say \"git branch,\" and you give it a nice name.", 
    "And then you can say \"git checkout\" to move into that branch.", 
    "So this is important, right?", 
    "There's a notion of the current branch that you're in, and when you CD, when", 
    "you change directory to go into your project, Git has a notion of which", 
    "branch you're in.", 
    "And it's in your interest to make sure that you know what Git thinks your", 
    "current branch is, so that you think you're editing the master branch, but", 
    "Git thinks you're editing some feature branch.", 
    "That could be badness.", 
    "If you just say \"git branch\" with no arguments, you'll see a list of all", 
    "your branches.", 
    "And there'll be a little mark next to the one that's current.", 
    "But there's a cooler thing.", 
    "There's a hack that the textbook refers to where, if you're in a Unix", 
    "environment, and who isn't, you can have the shell prompt tell you which", 
    "branch is the current branch.", 
    "It's a neat shell hack, so I recommend that you do that.", 
    "In fact, I think I can even demonstrate my shell hack.", 
    "I don't know if you guys can read my terminal window, but in my SaaS book", 
    "project, which is under Git control, I'm currently in the master branch.", 
    "But there's various other branches.", 
    "Yeah, I know.", 
    "And in fact, here's all my RottenPotatoes branches.", 
    "Wouldn't you love to have access to my laptop for a little while?", 
    "Look at all those juicy branches with things that appear to be homework", 
    "solutions in them.", 
    "But the important thing is that if I change to another branch, see, my", 
    "shell prompt changes too.", 
    "Isn't that nifty?", 
    "So I always know which branch I'm in.", 
    "The hack's in the book, kids.", 
    "All right.", 
    "So you've created your new branch.", 
    "You have switched to your new branch.", 
    "Now you can do whatever you want.", 
    "You can use all of the same commands.", 
    "You can edit files.", 
    "You can add and delete stuff, because it will not affect the master.", 
    "It will only affect your current branch.", 
    "If you wish, you can make a backup of your work, right?", 
    "You might as well take advantage of the idea that version control can back", 
    "up your work.", 
    "So here is a more general version of using Git push.", 
    "Because now, we don't want to push--", 
    "if we leave off these two arguments, the third argument is assumed to", 
    "represent the default remote, which if you set up your project in the way", 
    "that they GitHub website instructs, that's always origin and", 
    "it points to GitHub.", 
    "And the fourth argument is which branch you want to push.", 
    "But if you leave that off, it assumes master, because that's the branch", 
    "that's always created when you start a new repo.", 
    "So here, we're saying we want to push our CoolNewFeature", 
    "branch to the remote.", 
    "It still doesn't contaminate the master, but it gives us a backup on", 
    "GitHub of the stuff that we already did.", 
    "And strictly speaking, what it does is it creates a tracking branch.", 
    "What does that mean?", 
    "It means that really, the notion of branches is", 
    "independent for every repo.", 
    "So just because I created the branch on my own repo for my own machine", 
    "doesn't mean that that branch automatically got created on GitHub.", 
    "But, if I say push that branch, that will cause the corresponding branch to", 
    "be created, and now they're linked together.", 
    "So the changes to the branch on the remote will track changes to the", 
    "branch on my local repo.", 
    "There is a-- want to say something?", 
    "The question is, if you have a new branch, can you push your branch to", 
    "somebody else's branch on the origin repo?", 
    "So the general version of your question is, can I merge changes from", 
    "a branch called fu into a branch called bar?", 
    "And the general answer is yes, but you should be really sure that that's what", 
    "you mean to do.", 
    "Usually, what you probably mean to do is to first get a copy of the repo", 
    "that has both branches, then do a merge of the two branches.", 
    "Make sure that everything looks good, and then push the result", 
    "to one or the other.", 
    "Right?", 
    "So if the question is does Git support what you said, it does.", 
    "But it's probably not the best way to accomplish what you want.", 
    "I think as the example goes on, it'll come in more clear.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So I've created my branch.", 
    "I've written some code.", 
    "I've pushed my branch to GitHub so that I can at least back it up.", 
    "And now, when I'm satisfied that my new feature is ready to go, and I'm", 
    "ready to roll it into the master branch, now is when it could become", 
    "visible to others.", 
    "I switch back to the master branch on my own repo.", 
    "And I merge--", 
    "whoops, sorry.", 
    "It got cut off at the bottom there on the side screens.", 
    "But from within the master branch, I can now say merge all the changes from", 
    "the CoolNewFeature branch into the master branch.", 
    "And it's just like any other kind of merge, right?", 
    "It's like the merge we saw before, only now the merge is from one branch", 
    "into another, as opposed to just being because there were commits that were", 
    "out of date.", 
    "Why did I put the word warning here in red?", 
    "Because when I say git merge, and I give the name of a branch, it's going", 
    "to merge this into whatever my current branch is.", 
    "So be sure you know what the current branch is when you say git merge.", 
    "I have to explicitly check out master so that I know which branch is going", 
    "to receive this merge.", 
    "It's always the current branch.", 
    "So one more reason to do that little hack where the shell prompt tells you", 
    "what branch you're in.", 
    "So what about, how do branches interact with deployment?", 
    "Well, feature branches, like we said, especially in Agile development, tend", 
    "to have pretty short lifetimes.", 
    "They're born and they die usually within one iteration.", 
    "If you have a reason to have a longer lived branch, and in a moment we'll", 
    "show an example of why you might want to do that, like a release or a bug", 
    "fix branch, one thing that you can do is to avoid having your branch get too", 
    "far out of sync with the master.", 
    "The nightmare is, it's three weeks later and now you're finally ready to", 
    "merge your changes from the branch back into the master.", 
    "But the master has changed so much that you've got to do a", 
    "million manual edits.", 
    "A way to avoid that is, if you look up the documentation for git rebase,", 
    "basically it says, hey look, it's been a few days.", 
    "And I need for you to adjust things so that instead of having branched off a", 
    "commit that was three days ago, make it look so that I just branched off of", 
    "a commit that happened like today.", 
    "And that will probably require some manual adjustment on your part.", 
    "But it's kind of like doing an incremental merge now so that you", 
    "don't have to do a mega-painful big merge later on.", 
    "You can also, and again we'll see an example in a moment that motivates", 
    "this, is there's a command called git cherry-pick that can be used to take", 
    "only some specific commits and merge them.", 
    "So when we merged in the previous example here, when we said git merge", 
    "CoolNewFeature, basically all of the changes in CoolNewFeatures since it", 
    "branched off, however many commits that was, all of that is going to get", 
    "merged back into master.", 
    "But sometimes that's not necessarily what you want.", 
    "What you want is to take a subset of changes, possibly from another branch,", 
    "and merge those.", 
    "And we'll show you in a minute when you might want to do that.", 
    "We describe this in some more detail in the textbook.", 
    "Deploying from the master is the most common strategy that we've", 
    "seen Agile shops use.", 
    "That means that the code on the master branch is assumed to be clean.", 
    "That's the code that is well tested and, in theory, at any time it should", 
    "be safe to push the button and deploy whatever is on the master branch into", 
    "staging our production.", 
    "The master brand should never have anything less than the sort of best", 
    "tested stuff.", 
    "Having said that, there are scenarios, and these are especially common when", 
    "the thing you're distributing is not software as a service.", 
    "Let's say you're distributing a library, or the Linux", 
    "kernel, or a Ruby gem.", 
    "Those things have longer lived releases, right?", 
    "The release time between 1.3 and 1.4 of a gem could be weeks or months.", 
    "So in this case, there's a different strategy called branch per feature, or", 
    "release branch that some people use.", 
    "The idea is that when I'm ready to deploy, I can create--", 
    "not only do I deploy, but I create a new branch that reflects the state of", 
    "the software at the point of that deployment.", 
    "And now, what could I do with that?", 
    "Well, one possibility is, suppose I just deployed and in production, I", 
    "discover a bug that, for whatever reason, my test didn't cover when I", 
    "was in development.", 
    "Well, one thing I can do is I can fix the bug in the release branch.", 
    "So I fixed the bug at point B. I commit about bug fix.", 
    "Now, I can deploy again from this new point that has the bug fix.", 
    "But I can also selectively merge that bug fix back into the master.", 
    "So I can cherry pick this commit from the release branch, move it into the", 
    "master so that the small, surgical changes that I made to some files to", 
    "fix a bug now become part of the main development, too.", 
    "I can also go the other way.", 
    "Suppose after I've done all this, the security team finds that there is a", 
    "critical security bug, and even though they fixed it in the master, it really", 
    "also should be fixed in the production environment.", 
    "Well, again, I can do a merge in the other direction.", 
    "So when you're picking just specific commits from a branch, that's called a", 
    "cherry pick.", 
    "And when you have a branch that can do merges in both directions, that's", 
    "sometimes called a crisscross merge.", 
    "So-called because in some cases, the arrows might", 
    "actually cross each other.", 
    "You might have crossing commits in time.", 
    "So as I said, this is more common in the scenario where you want to have a", 
    "separate branch that's going to be long-lived.", 
    "The rationale here is if this branch represents a release, it's probably", 
    "going to be a while before the next major release.", 
    "And you want to be able to do things like quickly respond to bug fixes", 
    "without having to involve rebranching from the master every time.", 
    "So the release branch is sort of a stable place where you can do this.", 
    "One other concept that is ubiquitous in Git, but pretty new if you came", 
    "from something like Subversion, is the idea of a fork.", 
    "And in fact, the fork and branch are actually, in many ways, they're pretty", 
    "similar to each other.", 
    "The idea behind a fork is that rather than making a branch, I'm going to", 
    "like clone your entire repository.", 
    "So why would I want to do that?", 
    "Well, you have your project team that's working in this repo.", 
    "But I have a project team that thinks we could make some interesting", 
    "contribution to your app.", 
    "You're probably not in a hurry to give us edit access to", 
    "your golden repo copy.", 
    "So we'll clone your entire repo.", 
    "And when we finish making whatever changes we want to change, we will", 
    "create a branch, or create a set of commits that", 
    "encapsulates just our changes.", 
    "And we'll send you a pull request saying, hey, here's our contribution.", 
    "Wouldn't it be cool if you could pull our contribution into your code?", 
    "Then you can pull, just based on that pull request, and only those specific", 
    "changes get merged in.", 
    "And now, you have chosen to bring that stuff into your code base.", 
    "So this is a style of development that was really popularized by the Linux", 
    "development model, where you've got teams of teams all over the place, and", 
    "you need to selectively be able to bring in their changes.", 
    "And in fact, Linus Torvalds basically created Git to help support that", 
    "development model around the Linux kernel.", 
    "So whereas a branch is about creating a temporary branch just in this repo,", 
    "a fork is about cloning the entire repo.", 
    "And whereas a merge is the way that you fold changes in a branch back into", 
    "the master, or vice versa, a pull request is kind of like doing that at", 
    "the level of whole repos.", 
    "Here is a set of changes we've made in our repo, which began", 
    "as a copy of yours.", 
    "If you pull our changes, then your repo will get this great new", 
    "functionality.", 
    "So a couple of pitfalls that I, myself, have suffered on, and maybe I", 
    "can save you some pain.", 
    "This one is really subtle, and I'm going to explain it, because it was", 
    "not obvious, even to me.", 
    "Here's the scenario.", 
    "You've got your editor open, Emacs, of course.", 
    "Whatever it may be.", 
    "You've been editing a file, and you're in some branch.", 
    "Now you go over to your terminal window, you switch back", 
    "to a different branch.", 
    "Maybe it's because you're about to merge the results.", 
    "And then, without thinking, you go back into your editor window and", 
    "continue editing.", 
    "Bad.", 
    "Because whenever you switch branches or do a merge, even though it's not", 
    "obvious to you, the entire file structure in your local repo changes", 
    "out from under you.", 
    "So the file that you're editing in your editor buffer is no longer the", 
    "version that Git thinks is your current branch.", 
    "And if you save it, it goes to a place apparently in another dimension.", 
    "Because I haven't always been able to find it.", 
    "A safe thing to do is, if you saved a file, and now you're going to do some", 
    "branch related operations in your terminal window in your IDE, reopen", 
    "the file from the editor after you've done that, just to make sure that you", 
    "have the latest version.", 
    "Oh, Emacs warns you, too.", 
    "Emacs warns you if anything has changed out from under you.", 
    "The problem is, if you have tried to make changes like before you did the", 
    "branch operation, now the buffer that you have is in limbo.", 
    "You don't actually know where you're supposed to save it.", 
    "But enough said, right?", 
    "The pitfall here is, there is what you think you're editing.", 
    "And then, if you do some branch related commands, you may not be", 
    "editing what you think you're editing anymore.", 
    "The other one, as I said, is more like a in principle pitfall, which is", 
    "thinking that you don't need to create a new branch for this feature.", 
    "Because the change you're going to make is so simple, you'll just make it", 
    "directly on the master.", 
    "All I can say is, I've been burned by it, and you're going to be burned by", 
    "it zero or more times.", 
    "Try to make it a small number.", 
    "And then, after that, you'll make branches all the time.", 
    "And if the presence of the branches bothers you aesthetically, after", 
    "you've merged the branch, you can delete it.", 
    "There's nothing wrong with that.", 
    "The merge commit is still there, so you can still see what the master", 
    "branch looked like before you did the merge.", 
    "You haven't lost the ability to go back in time.", 
    "And if you don't want branches to clutter up your name space, you can", 
    "certainly do this.", 
    "Git even has a feature where you can give branches hierarchical names like", 
    "directories, so that you can sort of group branches together that do", 
    "related things, and stuff like that.", 
    "But use branches.", 
    "Branches are your friend.", 
    "OK.", 
    "So having said that, if you have separate sub-teams in your", 
    "organization, and one of them is primarily focusing on release bug", 
    "fixes, and the other one is focused primarily on new feature development,", 
    "which one should you use?", 
    "Branch per release, branch for feature, both of them, or you could", 
    "probably make the case for any of these."
