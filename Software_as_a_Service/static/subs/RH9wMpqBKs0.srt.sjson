    "SOLOM HEDDAYA: So this is my last slide, and I want to discuss this", 
    "concept of outside-in development.", 
    "This is one of the really fantastic, again, design aspects, design impacts", 
    "of agility.", 
    "And that is when you are forced to think longitudinally, you really are", 
    "forced to think about the eventual interface for the customer early on.", 
    "I use the term outside-in design because if you think about this", 
    "eventual interface with the customer very early in the product--", 
    "by the way, Sinofsky, who just left Windows.", 
    "When he joined Windows, one of the concepts he introduced is, he said,", 
    "I'm not going to approve any feature unless you have the demo for it.", 
    "This is trying to bring this benefit of outside-in, thinking from the", 
    "outside-in, to a three-year development cycle.", 
    "The reason I call two months--", 
    "and that's, by the way, on the upper end--", 
    "agile is that I think that people forget beyond that.", 
    "There's a limit to how much people will hold in their head, or how long.", 
    "That's my personal feeling.", 
    "I'm really not an expert in agile development.", 
    "I've only started working in this way a year and a half ago.", 
    "But this is my current feeling.", 
    "What would you say?", 
    "By the way, our standard cycle in my team is actually a week.", 
    "So there's a scrum meeting every morning, and then there's a", 
    "retrospective every week, and a demo every week.", 
    "But the idea is that you don't have to hit the demo point", 
    "with this week's work.", 
    "You can hit the demo point with the previous week's work, or maybe a few", 
    "weeks' work.", 
    "There is a real issue with what is the unit that you consider to be a", 
    "complete story.", 
    "And from my point of view, the unit has to be something that the customer", 
    "can tell right away.", 
    "And from Cosmos it's actually hard to come up with something, unless it's on", 
    "the user interface with the development, and management,", 
    "[INAUDIBLE].", 
    "It's hard to find something that the user will tell in a couple weeks.", 
    "So this outside-in development is very, very, very important.", 
    "It's a fantastic discipline, it's something that people who build", 
    "systems from the lower levels generally have a very murky view of.", 
    "They think about the customer as someone on another planet.", 
    "Like, who's this-- customer?", 
    "And usually the customer is considered to be a lower order of human being.", 
    "I know the customer's usually confused when they complain, ah, they just", 
    "don't understand how great the system is.", 
    "So this is a very, very, very good antidote.", 
    "A very, very good antidote.", 
    "But then how do you develop a full-scale solution?", 
    "This is only for large-scale services.", 
    "So start-ups--", 
    "I've been looking at what start-ups have been doing--", 
    "a lot of start-ups do the following to deal with this problem of full-scale.", 
    "They say, look, I don't even know if my business will succeed.", 
    "So I'll just build something with whatever is available in the open", 
    "source community, and I'll just push it out.", 
    "And then if I succeed, well, OK, now I have to go be more careful.", 
    "But then I'll have to throw away my code.", 
    "A lot of it, maybe not all of it, but a lot of it.", 
    "And so they accept that, and they keep iterating that way, throwing away code", 
    "and going to the next level.", 
    "And there are different rules of thumb about at what level of scale do you", 
    "really have to go to the next level.", 
    "The problem for a system like Cosmos that is already at a high scale is you", 
    "don't have that option.", 
    "We're already at such a high scale, and we pick up the entire business,", 
    "all of these thousands of developers, [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "It's a pretty tough situation.", 
    "And so you say, OK, how do we do that?", 
    "How do we get to full scale?", 
    "If you're going to push a feature, you need to know if it", 
    "works at scale or not.", 
    "That's the tension that also drives the times longer.", 
    "Then there's something kind of incidental.", 
    "It's kind of curious.", 
    "We've had debates over this.", 
    "How do you define agility in the first place?", 
    "Is it from the time of conception of the feature until delivery?", 
    "Is it latency?", 
    "Or is it the number of features you deliver per release cycle?", 
    "Is it throughput?", 
    "Is it feature throughput?", 
    "Which, if you think about it, is also very, very important because it's", 
    "really productivity, productivity of the developer.", 
    "And these two things are not unrelated.", 
    "From the customer's point of view, if you have high feature throughput they", 
    "will think that the system is changing and progressing very fast.", 
    "With every release you get, you develop all this", 
    "enormous amount of work.", 
    "Like I showed you, in six months we improved many of the key metrics for", 
    "the system by 30%, 40%.", 
    "Latency improvement, capacity improvement--", 
    "really incredible.", 
    "So you can say, this is actually feature throughput.", 
    "But at the same time people really care about latency.", 
    "So we have these debates.", 
    "And in the end we settled on something, at least", 
    "within our team, Cosmos.", 
    "We settled on saying, OK, we will focus on reducing the friction of the", 
    "development process, meaning the overhead.", 
    "How much time do you wait for a build?", 
    "How much time do you wait to run the tests?", 
    "These kinds of things can appear very mundane, but are really the key", 
    "sources of overhead.", 
    "And then of course, the ultimate--", 
    "this is where we have the most intense debate--", 
    "which is quality.", 
    "So Cosmos now, it's not just getting a lot of data, it's", 
    "getting a lot of code.", 
    "So we have an application compatibility problem.", 
    "We add new features.", 
    "We're almost like Windows-- well, nothing like Windows, but--", 
    "we're sort of--", 
    "qualitatively like Windows, where there's a huge number of applications", 
    "on top of us.", 
    "If we change a small feature in the language, or change something in the", 
    "optimizer, this can break some of these applications.", 
    "By the way, one of the interesting numbers about Cosmos is that 80% of", 
    "the work that Cosmos does, it does for production--", 
    "repetitive jobs, [INAUDIBLE] jobs.", 
    "And so if we hiccup, this means that somebody's going to have a problem in", 
    "their online services.", 
    "We can't break them.", 
    "So you say, if you push features too fast, you might either break data,", 
    "which is a disaster, like burning money, or you break an online service", 
    "that is relying on Cosmos.", 
    "And increasingly, Cosmos is part of a real-time loop that doesn't have", 
    "humans in the loop.", 
    "So that the code is being updated in the online service and user-facing", 
    "service based on computation that's being done in Cosmos.", 
    "So if the computation breaks, then the code update breaks, the spell checker", 
    "breaks, things like that.", 
    "The auto-suggest.", 
    "The queries break.", 
    "This can be significant.", 
    "Or we lose money.", 
    "Every ad click is worth 10's of cents or more.", 
    "On average, it's actually much more than that.", 
    "But then you say, we can't break that.", 
    "But at the same time we want to push the features back.", 
    "So one solution we've done--", 
    "because we want both, it's not like either-or--", 
    "so one solution is we use Cosmos to test Cosmos.", 
    "And so we basically use a lot of our capacity-- not a large fraction, but a", 
    "significant capacity--", 
    "to test practically all of the important jobs that run on Cosmos.", 
    "We run them hypothetically on the new code.", 
    "That works for the higher levels of the Cosmos stack because we can run", 
    "them in parallel, side by side, with the current version.", 
    "The lowest level in the stack, especially in the store, is very", 
    "difficult to run side by side.", 
    "And so that solution works for some parts of Cosmos.", 
    "And then, finally, there is this open-ended question, which is--", 
    "is agile methodology an addition to the planning process, or is it a", 
    "replacement?", 
    "And I believe it's an addition.", 
    "One of the things that happened in my team is that they adopted agile so", 
    "wholeheartedly that they no longer had any long-range plans.", 
    "And long-range is anything above six months.", 
    "Like in Windows, a long-range plan would be a decade.", 
    "But when you're building something really, really massive, you need to", 
    "think more than six months into the future, and you need to plan.", 
    "And that's where I believe that we have to combine.", 
    "But that's just an open question.", 
    "And this is something there's a lot of debate about now.", 
    "Microsoft is the strange beast of hiring, actually.", 
    "We are fanatics about hiring, absolutely fanatic about it.", 
    "We work very hard on it, and we give it much higher priority", 
    "than anything else.", 
    "But in terms of what we tell you what we need but we're not good at--", 
    "what we need is people who think about systems as a whole.", 
    "Microsoft has been absolutely fantastic in hiring people who tend to", 
    "think about data structures, and algorithms, and systems in the small.", 
    "This is an overstatement, but I'm just making a point.", 
    "We need people who think about systems in the large.", 
    "And so for example, one of the interesting problems in Cosmos that", 
    "should be obvious on the face of it is that we use the network in a way that", 
    "nobody else does.", 
    "We are a massively parallel processing system with high contention.", 
    "This is a very special beast.", 
    "We don't have any embarrassing parallelism.", 
    "We actually have high contention parallelism.", 
    "So you say, OK, so a team that has 100 people, how many networking", 
    "experts do you have?", 
    "Because obviously we're using the network in a completely strange way,", 
    "and so we have to have networking experts.", 
    "And the answer is zero.", 
    "And so why is that?", 
    "It's because the company has built it's greatness on a single box.", 
    "So that means that, when we go higher, we now are disproportionately looking", 
    "for those people.", 
    "People who think about the system as a whole, and of course people who", 
    "understand services.", 
    "In terms of practicality, the best way to--", 
    "if you're already here, if you're interested--", 
    "the best way to approach Microsoft is to talk to me.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "PROFESSOR: For right now, for today.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: Thank you very much.", 
    "[APPLAUSE]"
