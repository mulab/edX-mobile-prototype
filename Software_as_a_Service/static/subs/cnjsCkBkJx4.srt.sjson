    "JESSIE: So hi, everyone.", 
    "Like Richard said, my name is Jessie.", 
    "I took this course in the fall of 2010, and then graduated", 
    "in December, 2010.", 
    "So I know mostly what you guys are doing.", 
    "It's probably changed since I've taken it.", 
    "But I was hoping to come here and kind of tell you guys what nobody told me", 
    "when I was sitting in those seats.", 
    "I think there's a lot of stuff that you learn as you start a career in", 
    "software engineering-- you go out and get a job--", 
    "that is kind of hard to figure out when you're still in college.", 
    "It's nothing that you'll know about yet.", 
    "So that's kind of the point of this talk.", 
    "But I want it to be really informal.", 
    "I want you guys to ask me whatever you're curious about--", 
    "get whatever you want out of this.", 
    "So feel free to interrupt me.", 
    "Raise your hand, ask questions, whatever.", 
    "Before I start I kind of want to get an idea of the demographics here.", 
    "How many people are seniors?", 
    "Lots of seniors.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Mostly seniors.", 
    "Juniors?", 
    "All right.", 
    "Anybody sophomore or below that?", 
    "OK, not really.", 
    "That's good.", 
    "How many of you guys have done at least one internship before?", 
    "That's a decent amount.", 
    "Awesome.", 
    "Anybody already have a job lined up for when they're going to graduate,", 
    "especially you seniors?", 
    "OK.", 
    "That's a few people, but not too many.", 
    "That's good.", 
    "I gave this talk last semester in the spring, towards the end of semester.", 
    "And everybody already had a job.", 
    "And I felt like I was telling them things that may not have helped them,", 
    "since they already had gone through quite a bit of that.", 
    "So hopefully this will be helpful to you people that are looking for a job.", 
    "Even if you already have one lined up, this may help you once", 
    "you start your job.", 
    "And if you go to look for another job in the future.", 
    "So most of you people that have done internships, you'll know that they're", 
    "a really good way to kind of figure out what you want to do.", 
    "I say they're a great way to sample a company.", 
    "Because it's good to figure out whether you really like the company,", 
    "and what it's going to feel like day-to-day.", 
    "I think it's hard to get an idea of what a software engineering job is", 
    "really like if you haven't gone and done an internship.", 
    "And hopefully you people that are seniors have had a chance to do a", 
    "couple internships, hopefully at different companies.", 
    "So you can kind of compare what different companies feel like.", 
    "Because I think that there's a big difference between the way different", 
    "companies do things, and what your job is going to feel like day to day.", 
    "The type of things you're going to do, and how that's going to end up", 
    "projecting your career in one way or another.", 
    "So internships are good.", 
    "But I think once you do the internships, your biggest decision--", 
    "when you come to find a job when you're interviewing--", 
    "comes down to, should I work at a big company or a small company?", 
    "When I was in college, a lot of people had a lot of names in their head.", 
    "Like I want to work at Google, or Microsoft, or Facebook.", 
    "Or I want to work at a startup.", 
    "But I think that the experiences are probably similar in a", 
    "lot of those companies.", 
    "I think the real differentiation is between whether the company is a large", 
    "company or a small company.", 
    "And the reason for that is, it's going to really change your day to day life", 
    "as a software engineer, between large company and small company.", 
    "Small disclosure here, I'm a little bit biased towards smaller companies.", 
    "I did an internship at a big company.", 
    "I found that there's a lot of bureaucracy.", 
    "It's really, really slow trying to just develop things day to day.", 
    "And I've gone and worked at a couple small companies, and I think you get", 
    "to move a little faster.", 
    "You get to develop more stuff.", 
    "Maybe you get to reach your hands in different areas that you wouldn't get", 
    "to in a large company.", 
    "You might have just been moved off into this little area, and you only", 
    "touch this small piece of code, or this small area of the thing that", 
    "you're building.", 
    "At a smaller company you're going to have a chance to", 
    "touch a lot more things.", 
    "So I think that's a pretty important distinction.", 
    "I think once you kind of get an idea of which way you want to go there,", 
    "then you can start targeting your interviews a lot more.", 
    "Because I know that when I was sitting in this seat I was just like, spraying", 
    "out resumes to every company I could think of.", 
    "I was like, I just need to get as many interviews as possible--", 
    "as many offers as possible.", 
    "And then I will know the best one to do.", 
    "And I don't know if that's necessarily the case.", 
    "I think if you're able to target it, you'll have a much better experience", 
    "in the interviewing process.", 
    "And you'll have a better quality experience.", 
    "You'll be able to really find what you're looking for-- find a company", 
    "that's a good fit--", 
    "if you're more narrowly focused on this sort of thing.", 
    "So here's another thing that nobody told me.", 
    "It's not always true, depending on who your interviewing with--", 
    "this is really true when you get into the real world.", 
    "Your code is your resume as a software engineer.", 
    "Your GPA may matter when you're interviewing at a large company, who", 
    "knows that you're coming straight out of college, and they have no other way", 
    "to gauge you.", 
    "But if you have code that you can show a company, that shows them a lot more", 
    "than a bunch of grades.", 
    "I think that you should do side projects.", 
    "You should do the type of projects that you have in this class.", 
    "And be able to show those to people.", 
    "Because that will put you far and above someone that has no projects on", 
    "their resume.", 
    "They just have, you know, here's my GPA.", 
    "And I took this class and this class and this class.", 
    "Sure, that's great.", 
    "Everybody that went through that program took that class and that class", 
    "and that class.", 
    "But if you can show them that you have actually done something--", 
    "here's what I built.", 
    "You know, view the source.", 
    "You can see the code that I wrote.", 
    "That's a lot more meaningful to someone who's interviewing you, then", 
    "just the GPA.", 
    "But it also depends on their part.", 
    "How much research did they do into you?", 
    "Did they go and look at that app, or did they just read your resume and", 
    "throw it into a pile?", 
    "So yes.", 
    "This class is a great way to show off one of those projects.", 
    "As you go forward in your career, it's good to have side projects, or work on", 
    "open source things.", 
    "And like put those things up on GitHub.", 
    "Like, GitHub becomes your resume when you are a software engineer.", 
    "Especially if you're working in smaller companies.", 
    "If you do any work in open-source development, that's a great way for", 
    "people to see what you have done.", 
    "And point them at that, as opposed to some generic big thing.", 
    "Like, oh, I worked at this company for a year and a half.", 
    "That sounds OK.", 
    "But then when you say, oh, so I built this queuing system that these 500", 
    "companies use in their code every day.", 
    "That sounds much more awesome.", 
    "And people will be more willing to take a look at you, and talk to you,", 
    "and be more interested in you, if you're able to show", 
    "them things like that.", 
    "So when a company is interviewing you, you're also interviewing them.", 
    "I didn't know this when I was interviewing, coming out of college.", 
    "I thought, I applied to this company, they invited me into an interview.", 
    "So if they give me an offer, then I want to work here.", 
    "I definitely do.", 
    "That's how it works, right?", 
    "And that's not totally true.", 
    "Because there's not really that much that you know about a company when", 
    "you're first applying.", 
    "You have very little insight into--", 
    "who you're going to be working with, the type of projects you're going to", 
    "be working on, what your day-to-day life is going to be.", 
    "So the interview is for them to see what your skill set is--", 
    "what you're good at, what your strengths and weaknesses are.", 
    "But it's also your chance to interview the people that you may possibly be", 
    "working with.", 
    "And I think that's really important.", 
    "I think you should always ask questions.", 
    "There will always come a point in an interview where they say, do you have", 
    "any questions for me?", 
    "And you should have questions ready.", 
    "Ask them things about--", 
    "what's a day in the life of an engineer at your company?", 
    "What kind of technologies are using?", 
    "What team would I be working on?", 
    "Will I get to move around?", 
    "Things like that.", 
    "Always have questions, because it is important to know what", 
    "you're going into.", 
    "And if you have multiple offers, to see which place is going", 
    "to fit me the best."
