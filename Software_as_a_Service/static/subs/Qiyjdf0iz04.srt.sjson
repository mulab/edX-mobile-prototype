    "OK, so I work at Pivotal, right?", 
    "So what about testing?", 
    "Everybody wants to know--", 
    "this is probably, what--", 
    "I'm 34 slides in.", 
    "I'm nearly halfway through this presentation and I haven't put a test", 
    "up on this page at all.", 
    "Armando, you should fire me.", 
    "You're thinking about it?", 
    "Excellent.", 
    "So this where Jasmine came from.", 
    "This is how I basically taught myself JavaScript is I", 
    "wrote a test framework.", 
    "And I wrote a test framework because, at the time, four years ago, everybody", 
    "was thinking about JavaScript much in the way that we've made it to this", 
    "point in the presentation which is its sort of magic sprinkles that we sort", 
    "of spread over our DOM and stuff happens.", 
    "And all of the testing frameworks out there including JsUnit which is", 
    "written by my boss, grandboss.", 
    "Really had this implicit assumption that we're dealing with a request", 
    "response cycle back to the server all the time, which is kind of a pain in", 
    "the neck because as we all know, if you open up Firebug or open up the", 
    "console, you can sit there and play with the JS console and do expressions", 
    "all the time.", 
    "It's [INAUDIBLE] you can do all sorts of neat things there.", 
    "I wanted to make a testing framework that was really--", 
    "didn't worry about the DOM, didn't worry about events in the DOM, but", 
    "rather, just dealt with the language by itself.", 
    "So this is where Jasmine came from.", 
    "Actually, right, it would be four years Thanksgiving.", 
    "Jasmine was the project I worked on four years ago at Thanksgiving so I", 
    "could stay out of the kitchen while my mom and-- well, actually my sister and", 
    "my dad fought.", 
    "Always good to have side projects for moments like that.", 
    "So has anybody played with Jasmine at all?", 
    "Anybody?", 
    "Omer, raise your hand.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Stuck with me all of last summer with that.", 
    "So looks a little bit like RSpec, right?", 
    "Totally stolen from RSpec.", 
    "A loving homage from a different language.", 
    "So really, what you're seeing here, top down, describes are just blocks", 
    "literally and figuratively.", 
    "It's just a block of code.", 
    "We call them suites in Jasmine.", 
    "It's a function that gets called right away when you call describe.", 
    "It gets a string so it can identify it and its child describes.", 
    "The befores and its get queued up later.", 
    "But the before says, hey, before each function in this suite, make sure to", 
    "set the deck to that variable.", 
    "And then within the it, there it gets to our assertion, you do the expect", 
    "actual dot to-- in this case, to equal, to get the matcher.", 
    "And that's really it.", 
    "All this is doing is these get evaled the way anything else would.", 
    "The describe function calls the function that got passed to it to", 
    "build up this tree of functions including all the befores.", 
    "Yes, you can have afters.", 
    "And then the its are the actual tests so that when you run this code, which", 
    "Jasmine has a top level-- hey, execute the suite--", 
    "we track all of the assertions as the tree runs.", 
    "So then you can get your great red green tests.", 
    "And I'll show you the runner in a second.", 
    "Really straightforward.", 
    "You can negate any expectation with a dot not.", 
    "You can write custom matchers.", 
    "There's a bunch of other things you can do.", 
    "I think that's my next slide.", 
    "In fact, yes.", 
    "What else can we do?", 
    "There's a mock clock in Jasmine so if you look up the JS environments have", 
    "set interval and set timeout.", 
    "Say hey, call something in the future.", 
    "We can mock that out and make that synchronous bc asynchronousity would", 
    "break your head.", 
    "We can create test doubles.", 
    "They're spies.", 
    "They're basically functions that do kind of whatever you want even though", 
    "they replace the actual implementation so you can track parameters to", 
    "functions, all sorts of neat things like that.", 
    "But mostly, it's used for test doubles.", 
    "There's a separate library for mocking Ajax, faking Ajax, so you can say, OK,", 
    "take that request that just got fired and give it this text response as if", 
    "the server actually responded.", 
    "And we can go exercise all of the happy paths and the error paths, the", 
    "dones in the errors as before.", 
    "You can write custom matchers.", 
    "There's also some kind of wonky for async test.", 
    "This page--", 
    "if you've not seen in it--", 
    "all the way on the right here.", 
    "This page is the Jasmine-- if you go to pivotal.github.com/jasmine, as the", 
    "URL says, right?", 
    "Yes.", 
    "Good, I got that right.", 
    "This is the entire library, basically, everything and anything", 
    "you can do with it.", 
    "The Ajax stuff is separate.", 
    "I'll show you that in a minute, Armando.", 
    "I'll bring that up.", 
    "With some rough description.", 
    "This is Docco/Rocco, which is a neat library to take comments within code", 
    "and build an HTML page.", 
    "Available both for node and I use the Ruby one.", 
    "What's neat though, and I love this--", 
    "this is my favorite part of this entire page.", 
    "That is what the runner looks like.", 
    "So this page, when it loaded, actually executed all 53 specs,", 
    "our green dots there.", 
    "If I refresh it, it runs it again.", 
    "Oh, the timing's off.", 
    "Little CSS problem.", 
    "Anyway, it runs in like 8/100 of a second or something crazy like that.", 
    "What's neat, this is the first time I've had executable documentation on", 
    "any project I've worked on in 20 years.", 
    "If I break the Jasmine API with one of my tests, this page breaks, which is", 
    "kind of cool.", 
    "So if you ever go to this page and any of these is red, you can email me and", 
    "yell at me.", 
    "Jasmine, as I said, is meant to be to your JS what our RSpec is to your Ruby", 
    "with the idea that you should be able to test drive anything in your JS just", 
    "like you would test drive your Ruby.", 
    "This is the runner for something a little bit bigger, 112", 
    "specs in 3/4 of a second.", 
    "It really is this simple, actually.", 
    "If you include the Jasmine Ajax project as part of your helpers, it's", 
    "really small, supports both jQuery and prototype JS which, at this point, is", 
    "stone age when it comes to JS front ends.", 
    "But that was the default in the Rails 1 and Rails 2 world.", 
    "Basically, you say, hey Jasmine Ajax, I'm going to use mock.", 
    "And at this point--", 
    "sorry, if this is my app code or my code under test, and then right about", 
    "here is this XMLHttpRequest object we talked about before, right?", 
    "It's browser native.", 
    "It's got a JSAPI on it so that I can talk to it from my app", 
    "code for my test code.", 
    "But it's about to go out to the ether, right?", 
    "It's got this little shim to go into native code.", 
    "There's a little bit of JS right here.", 
    "And when you call jasmine dot Ajax dot UseMock, we inject some horrible,", 
    "horrible stuff right here.", 
    "Let's hear it for duck typing and interpreted languages, right?", 
    "So basically, we throw some stuff right here that stops the Ajax request", 
    "from ever leaving.", 
    "So it never leaves the browser.", 
    "So now, here's my favorite reason why we have this code.", 
    "So in 2009, Jasmine had come out of this effort for us-- we were working", 
    "with Palm and webOS, rest its soul.", 
    "And we were working on a Twitter client.", 
    "We were working on a Twitter client because everybody writes a Twitter", 
    "client, or at least three years ago, everybody did.", 
    "And we actually had Pivots--", 
    "Twitter was a client of ours.", 
    "So there were Pivots down the street at Twitter.", 
    "So I knew if I was having any trouble with the APIs, I could get a hold of", 
    "somebody at lunch and say, hey, explain to me how this works.", 
    "So we're doing this development, we're writing this app,", 
    "things are going well.", 
    "And I have lunch with my friend Zach who was one of the Pivots over at", 
    "Twitter who said, hey, did you know that Tweed, which was the app that", 
    "we'd written--", 
    "Tweed is the number three API consumer at Twitter?", 
    "I said, really?", 
    "So Palm, at that point, had sold about 500,000 phones, maybe 70,000 or 80,000", 
    "people downloaded this.", 
    "Why in the world were we the number three API consumer of the Twitter API?", 
    "And the answer is because we weren't mocking our Ajax which meant that", 
    "every time I was running tests, which was several hundreds of times a day,", 
    "we raided the Twitter API.", 
    "Bad, right?", 
    "It's funny.", 
    "It's hilarious.", 
    "It's embarrassing.", 
    "You could get into whole things about we were exercising Twitter and they", 
    "were a client of ours and conflict of interest if you want.", 
    "But it comes down to the day, we weren't mocking Ajax.", 
    "So if we come back to my little stage presentation here, what happens is", 
    "now, let's assume that on line 10 when I call deck.shuffle that it's going to", 
    "go out there and talk to some server and get a truly random shuffle deck.", 
    "Back up.", 
    "Line 12, register.", 
    "That deck register.", 
    "Once I have a shuffled back or a deck that hasn't been shuffled, I'm going", 
    "to register that deck with the pit boss so that when the shuffle happens,", 
    "I know it's legit.", 
    "That's the setting the stage here.", 
    "So that register should make a call up and say, hey, global pit boss, I'm a", 
    "deck and I've been created and I'm about to do something.", 
    "But if there's an Ajax request down in that register call, it's not going to", 
    "make it past here.", 
    "It's not here at all.", 
    "But I've got this global function called most recent Ajax request that", 
    "will go and, because I've trapped that Ajax request and I've saved it off, I", 
    "can go get that object and muck with it.", 
    "So I can then say I want to respond with a successful registration,", 
    "whatever the heck that is.", 
    "And now, if I shuffle, I'm allowed to shuffle because the deck is legit.", 
    "So you can imagine having nested suites.", 
    "And I've written this again and again and again--", 
    "of happy path, negative path, error path.", 
    "500.", 
    "Can't find the pit boss, and so I can't shuffle this deck.", 
    "All that stuff.", 
    "What's nice about this, conceptually, from a test modeling perspective is", 
    "that I can actually write my code knowing that I can go all the way out", 
    "and make that call but have it be faked.", 
    "And then I can manually send these test responses.", 
    "The best part about this is it takes this naturally asynchronous--", 
    "that's the A in Ajax, first A in Ajax--", 
    "and make it synchronous which then doesn't break your head when you're", 
    "writing code.", 
    "But it also allows you to have a shared before and", 
    "therefore, you can have--", 
    "also easier to retest.", 
    "But you could imagine that register call could be up on a before.", 
    "And then you could have a suite for the negative case and a suite for the", 
    "positive case."
