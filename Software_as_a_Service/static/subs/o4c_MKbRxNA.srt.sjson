    "DANNY BURKES: OK, I'll go on.", 
    "I know you guys are either now or soon to be in the job market.", 
    "I thought I'd talk about how we hire and how that's different.", 
    "You've see how the way we develop software is kind of quite different", 
    "than many of the companies that might have presented at your job fair.", 
    "Well, the way we hire is just as different.", 
    "Let's talk about how we hire.", 
    "And hiring is not just, we need to get good people to put on projects.", 
    "It's about how do we grow as a company.", 
    "Because we're not satisfied with the size that we are.", 
    "We want to get bigger.", 
    "We want to bring this development methodology to more and more clients.", 
    "And we can only do that if we can hire people.", 
    "The thing I'd say about the job market is prepare yourself, not really the", 
    "job market, but about interviewing.", 
    "Prepare yourself.", 
    "The reason that I would say that is because it is absolutely horrible to", 
    "go on job interviews.", 
    "What's wrong with that?", 
    "What's wrong with the way job interviews are conducted customarily?", 
    "Well, the accepted best practice for how you hire developers", 
    "is completely broken.", 
    "And that is because that practice basically consists of, \"Hi,", 
    "thanks for coming in.", 
    "Let me show you this conference room where you can sit for five hours while", 
    "I bring 10 people through and talk to you about what you want to", 
    "do with your life.", 
    "And then maybe we'll do some whiteboard problems.", 
    "And you can show me what a link list looks like.", 
    "And you can draw some arrows.", 
    "And then we'll get those 10 people in a room.", 
    "And they'll toss some coins and decide whether we make you an offer.\" I mean,", 
    "that was a little bit over the top, but not much, really.", 
    "You get to sit there for a while and get talked to and asked questions.", 
    "You might get to draw some stuff on a whiteboard.", 
    "But you learned how to write software, right, not how to draw things on a", 
    "whiteboard.", 
    "And all these conversations and the way they try to--", 
    "those whiteboard problems are about skill assessment, about trying to find", 
    "out something about how good you are at something.", 
    "But they don't do that.", 
    "They don't do that at all.", 
    "Because if you want to develop software the Pivotal way, the way we", 
    "think is best for you and clients, you have to collaborate with people.", 
    "You have to be able to work together on a problem.", 
    "And there's nothing that I described there that constitutes working", 
    "together on a problem.", 
    "The whiteboard exercises aren't them saying, hey, let's do this together.", 
    "They're them telling you, hey, go do this.", 
    "Here's the marker, let me sit down and watch you.", 
    "More of what's wrong, people hire for specific technical skills.", 
    "They'll get you in the room, and they'll look at your resume.", 
    "And they'll ask, \"We're doing a lot of Hadoop here, you know", 
    "anything about Hadoop?", 
    "What have you done with Hadoop?\"", 
    "\"Hey, we're thinking about doing this iOS project, you ever done Objective", 
    "C?\" They want to know if you can help them today.", 
    "And that is just wrong.", 
    "And I'll talk later about why that's wrong.", 
    "Overlooking or ignoring communication difficulties, like I said before, we", 
    "believe that software development is about communicating.", 
    "If you can't communicate, you're not going to do well.", 
    "And in doing all these specific technical skill questions and these", 
    "whiteboard exercises, what you might get out of that, hey, this person is", 
    "super bright, super intelligent.", 
    "They answered every question I asked them correctly.", 
    "But they were really fidgety.", 
    "And they didn't look like they were comfortable talking to me.", 
    "And they weren't really that friendly.", 
    "But I'll just ignore that, because they were so good at the code.", 
    "And maybe you can ignore that in some companies, because you can put these", 
    "people in a cube over in the corner somewhere and just have them check", 
    "their stuff into the repo and then, hey, I got some software here.", 
    "But don't talk to that person, because they're not really very nice.", 
    "Maybe you can do that in some companies.", 
    "You can't do that at Pivotal, because we got to talk to clients", 
    "all day, every day.", 
    "Hiring blind, what that really means is all the stuff I just described", 
    "about what happens in a normal job interview isn't about coding.", 
    "How in the world can you hire someone to code without", 
    "coding with that person?", 
    "It's ridiculous.", 
    "It makes no sense.", 
    "And the biggest thing that's wrong is that I needed wo slides to", 
    "say what was wrong.", 
    "I couldn't even put it on one slide all the things that are messed up", 
    "about the way that people hire.", 
    "OK, let's talk about the way we do it and why we think it's better.", 
    "Our hiring process is really, really simple.", 
    "We have internal recruiters who are really good at identifying people who", 
    "might be good for Pivotal.", 
    "And that's sometimes based off a resume.", 
    "Sometimes it's based on meeting you at a career fair or a", 
    "personal referral, whatever.", 
    "At some point we get a list of people who we think might be good for Pivotal", 
    "and might enjoy working at Pivotal.", 
    "And we put all those people through a first-round round pairing interview.", 
    "And by pairing interview, I mean, literally, we pair", 
    "with you on a problem.", 
    "I'd say half of these we do in the office, the other half we do by Skype.", 
    "I actually prefer the ones in the office, because I can get a much", 
    "better idea of someone's personality if I'm standing beside them.", 
    "Over Skype I really can't get that great of an idea.", 
    "But it's the same interview, nonetheless, whether it's over Skype", 
    "or in person.", 
    "It takes about 45 minutes, and we pair together on a programming problem.", 
    "So, if you come in the office, you will stand beside me at my desk.", 
    "And we will work together and pair and do TDD on this programming problem", 
    "that we have.", 
    "It's about general concepts.", 
    "It's not about a specific technology.", 
    "It's more about problem solving skills.", 
    "Like, when I ask you how we should proceed here, you had an innovative", 
    "idea of how that would work.", 
    "You made good suggestions.", 
    "But more important is empathy and communication.", 
    "And by empathy, I mean were you listening to me?", 
    "When I presented a problem to you, and I wrote a test and it failed, which is", 
    "the first part of TDD, and I said to you, \"OK, what's the simplest way we", 
    "can make this pass,\" did you hear that word, \"simplest\"?", 
    "Were you listening?", 
    "There's 1,000 ways you can make the test pass.", 
    "There's not a right answer.", 
    "But there is a notion of were you listening and were you engaged in what", 
    "we were doing?", 
    "And it's not that I want to tell you what to do.", 
    "It's just that I want to pair with you.", 
    "That's about being open to doing things new ways and communication.", 
    "Again, I mean, we're talking, we're pairing.", 
    "This isn't me talking to you.", 
    "I'm listening, as well.", 
    "I have to do all the things that I'm asking you to do.", 
    "So, that first round interview, like I said, takes about 45 minutes.", 
    "And we have actually a very like strict way that we score those.", 
    "We come out of that with a number.", 
    "And we have kind of a cutoff point.", 
    "And we say if you score above that number, we'll have you back for the", 
    "second round interview.", 
    "The second round interview is really very simple.", 
    "You come in and you work at Pivotal for a day.", 
    "You are a Pivot.", 
    "You will pair with two different Pivots, one in the", 
    "morning, one in the afternoon.", 
    "Probably, both of those pairings will be on real client projects.", 
    "You'll be working on a real project, whatever happens to be in the office", 
    "at the time.", 
    "And it's not faked up.", 
    "And it's not a synthetic problem.", 
    "And it's not a whiteboard.", 
    "You're going to sit down and write code.", 
    "That round is more skill-specific, but not overly.", 
    "And I'll talk about later why we don't really care about specific skills.", 
    "It's mostly about cultural fit.", 
    "And by that I mean, eventually we want to get down to the point where we ask", 
    "the person you paired with, hey, would you want to sit beside this person for", 
    "the next 6 months?", 
    "Because if we hire them, that's what you're going to be doing.", 
    "There's definitely a technical part of it.", 
    "We want you to understand the way we develop software and the", 
    "skills that we need.", 
    "But more than anything, we want to be pretty confident that you're going to", 
    "get along with people and you're going to be happy there.", 
    "Well, I think practically speaking, we want you to just be half of the pair.", 
    "We want you to drive sometimes and navigate sometimes.", 
    "Practically speaking, most people are a little bit intimidated when they", 
    "come in for that second interview.", 
    "They hold back for a while.", 
    "They don't really want to drive for a while.", 
    "But what we want to see is that at some point during that interview, you", 
    "actually are comfortable enough with the process to start driving, to start", 
    "typing, to start doing the tests.", 
    "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "DANNY BURKES: No, we don't try to trick people.", 
    "We're working on stories for clients.", 
    "We actually want to get this done.", 
    "We don't want to delay.", 
    "We want to get it done.", 
    "STUDENT: You're working on real stories?", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Yeah, real projects.", 
    "We do have some internal projects that you might get put on for one of those", 
    "pairings if real client projects aren't available or not suitable.", 
    "Some clients ask us not to interview on their projects.", 
    "Others, they're fine if we interview.", 
    "But they might be at a stage in the project where, hey, we're going to", 
    "push to production for the first time tomorrow, not a good time to do", 
    "interviews.", 
    "So, as real client projects are available, you will", 
    "pair on those projects.", 
    "And they're usually available.", 
    "So, it's the exception rather than the rule that you wouldn't be on a real", 
    "client project.", 
    "STUDENT: What are the numbers, the number of people you do 45 minute", 
    "interviews, the number of the second round, the number who you hire?", 
    "DANNY BURKES: You mean the drop off rates?", 
    "STUDENT: Yeah.", 
    "DANNY BURKES: I don't have that.", 
    "I wouldn't even speculate.", 
    "STUDENT: Not 50-50?", 
    "DANNY BURKES: I know the first round.", 
    "Because the first round I actually personally do most of", 
    "those for San Francisco.", 
    "My experience is right now our recruiters are really, really good at", 
    "screening people out before they even get to the first round.", 
    "The people who get to the first round in San Francisco, I'd say, 65 to 70", 
    "percent of them make it to the second round.", 
    "That number was considerably lower two years ago before we had the people", 
    "internally doing the recruiting that we do now.", 
    "And that's it.", 
    "By that's it, I mean that's our recruiting process.", 
    "After you do that second-round interview, the two Pivots that you", 
    "paired with will give their feedback to the hiring manager.", 
    "And we'll make you an offer or not.", 
    "That's it.", 
    "If you make it all the way, you've spent 8 hours, which is more than the", 
    "five that you'd spend in a room.", 
    "But it's a hell of a lot more productive and fun.", 
    "You're writing, you're getting to demonstrate to us what you're claiming", 
    "you're really good at.", 
    "If you think you're good at software development, you think you're good", 
    "enough to do this professionally, then show us.", 
    "I'd rather be in a position where I could succeed or fail based on what I", 
    "was trained and educated to do, rather than talk to eight people.", 
    "My experience with those scenarios where they get people in a room and", 
    "they talk is that the way the companies do that is that they say", 
    "that, hey, OK we're going to bring in the eight people that talked to that", 
    "person and ask them if we should hire or not.", 
    "And they usually have a requirement of unanimity.", 
    "So, if there's 1 person out of those 8 that says, no, we shouldn't hire.", 
    "Then they won't hire.", 
    "So, I don't want my fate to be in the hands of 8 people that I've never even", 
    "met before.", 
    "I'd rather just be able to show what I can do in the code.", 
    "I described the process, why is it better for Pivotal,", 
    "for the hiring company?", 
    "It's better because we're hiring you to code, so you've got to be a", 
    "productive coder.", 
    "You've got to be.", 
    "And we're a consulting company, so you've got to be able to relate to", 
    "non-technical people.", 
    "You've got to be personable.", 
    "You've got to be able to collaborate with humans.", 
    "And we pair all the time.", 
    "You have to be able to collaborate.", 
    "Those 3 things that we absolutely have to have are all things that are", 
    "directly tested by this way of interviewing.", 
    "You're coding in the interview.", 
    "You're talking to people during the interview.", 
    "And you're collaborating with the developers during the interview.", 
    "It directly probes all of the things that we think you need to be", 
    "successful at Pivotal.", 
    "Why is it better or for the candidate?", 
    "Well, I'd ask three questions of the candidate, or I'd", 
    "ask it of you, actually.", 
    "How do you feel about pairing every day?", 
    "Do you think that's something you could do, that you would like?", 
    "You don't want to get a job that you hate.", 
    "How do you feel about talking all day?", 
    "It's tiring.", 
    "It actually is very tiring to talk all day.", 
    "And when we hire people, the first couple of weeks, generally almost all", 
    "of them say, wow, it's really tiring working here.", 
    "How do you feel about having very little private time during a day?", 
    "And the answer to that is that you don't know, because you've never done", 
    "any of these things.", 
    "This process is good for you because you get to do it for a day.", 
    "You think you want to be a Pivot, well just come be a Pivot,", 
    "see if you like it.", 
    "Because the process isn't just about us saying whether we think you are", 
    "good for us.", 
    "It's about you saying whether you think we'd be good for you.", 
    "So what are we looking for in people that we hire?", 
    "And what are the qualities that we think would make you successful at", 
    "Pivotal and make you love working at Pivotal?", 
    "Solid fundamentals in programming and software engineering, you're here,", 
    "you're getting that, right?", 
    "Check mark, you're done there.", 
    "Curiosity and hunger to learn new skills, I find that that is really a", 
    "personality feature of people who are in this field anyway.", 
    "Most software engineers that I have met love learning new languages and", 
    "new tool kits and new paradigms.", 
    "Curiosity usually isn't something that we see that people lack.", 
    "What we see that they lack are the next few things, which is the humility", 
    "to say, I \" I don't know.\"", 
    "Pairing is about people asking, \"Hey, I don't know how to do this, do you?\"", 
    "Are you comfortable saying, no, I don't know how to do it?", 
    "Or are you like, I read something once, yes, I know how to do that?", 
    "You have to be humble, because you have to admit that you don't know", 
    "things, because that's the only way to learn.", 
    "And the flip side of that is the eagerness to say, \"Let's try it and", 
    "see what happens.\" Pairing isn't about always coming up with the perfect", 
    "solution or even knowing what a solution is.", 
    "It's just about trying things, being willing to fail and not being", 
    "embarrassed by failure.", 
    "Personability, well, of course, if you're a jerk, you're not going to be", 
    "a good pair.", 
    "Because nobody is going to want to pair with you.", 
    "And this last point is really not about software engineering at all.", 
    "It's about being a consultant.", 
    "We're a consultancy.", 
    "Our duty is to the client.", 
    "Our duty is to produce the best software we can for the client and", 
    "give them our best advice.", 
    "And you have to have the confidence to deliver your best advice and also", 
    "realize that sometimes the client just ignores it.", 
    "You can give the best advice of your life, and the client can", 
    "still screw it up.", 
    "And you have to, in my experience, not get personally invested in the success", 
    "of the client.", 
    "I want to help them as much as I can.", 
    "But in the end, they can always say no.", 
    "What we're not looking for so, this is important.", 
    "We are not looking for specific technology skills.", 
    "We don't care if you've ever done a Hadoop cluster or if you know how to", 
    "do MapReduce.", 
    "Why?", 
    "Because this is a very fickle industry.", 
    "If I hire you for a specific skill today, I can guarantee you that 18", 
    "months from now there's going to be another skill that's more important to", 
    "me that you don't have.", 
    "I'm not really concerned with what you have today.", 
    "I'm concerned with your ability to get something 6 months, 12 months, 18", 
    "months from now.", 
    "We take all types of clients.", 
    "Clients present to us with problems that we don't know how to solve, that", 
    "we don't have institutional knowledge of, yeah, let's just do what we did", 
    "that other time and that's going to work here.", 
    "Sometimes we tell clients, hey, look we don't have a canned solution to", 
    "what you want to do.", 
    "But what we have is a lot of really smart people who are great at figuring", 
    "things out.", 
    "And another, if you already know all this stuff, if you already know Rails,", 
    "if you already know RSpec, if you already just think you're great at it,", 
    "how are you going to get any better?", 
    "Job satisfaction to me isn't about being happy today.", 
    "It's about getting better over time.", 
    "The intellectual curiosity part of it is about, hey, what I want to do and", 
    "what makes me feel great is learning.", 
    "And so that's not about what you know today.", 
    "Another thing we're not looking for is, as I mentioned, highly skilled", 
    "introverts.", 
    "A lot of those in this--", 
    "not this room, of course-- but in this industry, should I say?", 
    "A lot of really highly skilled introverts that can do very well at a", 
    "company that doesn't require you to talk to people.", 
    "But that's not Pivotal.", 
    "We really need people skills.", 
    "If you can't explain what you want to do to a client, or can't explain", 
    "advice to them on how to help them, then you can't help them.", 
    "And what you're supposed to be doing at Pivotal is helping clients.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: I actually got called by a reporter yesterday, and it was", 
    "about the firing of those eight guys at Microsoft and the", 
    "Apple guy who got fired.", 
    "She called to ask me, have things changed in software engineering?", 
    "Because these people were both fired, and the excuses were they were", 
    "difficult to get along with.", 
    "And her question was, gee, I thought computer people were, by definition,", 
    "difficult to get along with, like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.", 
    "Has something happened in software so that personal skills is more important", 
    "now than it used to be?", 
    "So, I was trying to say, yes.", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Well, I think that's definitely true of the methodologies", 
    "that we use.", 
    "But I would say that with regard to Microsoft and Apple, they strike me as", 
    "pretty dictatorial software development organizations.", 
    "It's hard for me to believe that those particular people were fired because", 
    "they couldn't get along with other developers.", 
    "But I hope that we can grow Pivotal and spread this methodology around so", 
    "that, yes, people skills will become more important.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: It's basically agile devolopment, [INAUDIBLE] teams and", 
    "working with-- yeah, I guess, agile.", 
    "You need people skills.", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Yes, but people have been getting fired for", 
    "being jerks for centuries.", 
    "So, I don't think it's necessarily applicable in this case.", 
    "I hope that 10, 20 years down the line, people who we are training now", 
    "will be in those positions.", 
    "So, they won't have to worry about people skills.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: That's kind of what I said.", 
    "I think, and we said this in class yesterday, the single, superhero", 
    "programmer era has passed.", 
    "And maybe those people grew up in that time.", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Yeah, well, it's not as passed as I'd like it to be.", 
    "But we're trying to change that.", 
    "We see a lot of superheroes in clients, clients that come to us", 
    "needing help.", 
    "And the reason they need help is because what", 
    "they're doing isn't working.", 
    "I wouldn't say most, but many of our clients come to us because what", 
    "they're doing isn't working.", 
    "And in a lot of those cases what they're doing is that they've got one", 
    "or two people who are running the show and have this kind of dictatorial", 
    "style of technology decisions and enforcing things.", 
    "And it's not working.", 
    "And working in our methodology is really, really difficult for those", 
    "people, really difficult.", 
    "And we sometimes have to deliver advice to clients like, 3 months in", 
    "when the client sees, hey, you guys are executing at a pace that we never", 
    "even came close to.", 
    "You're really successful at implementing what we want.", 
    "We're in a much better position than we were 3 months ago.", 
    "What can you tell us?", 
    "How can we continue this?", 
    "Sometimes the advice is, well, you got to get rid of that guy.", 
    "Because he's never going to do this after you leave here.", 
    "They ignore that advice sometimes, like I said.", 
    "But we give it, because that's our duties to the client.", 
    "They want our best advice.", 
    "STUDENT: I just want to say, I don't think Steven Sinofsky was fired.", 
    "He just quit.", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Well, quitting is a corporate euphemism for being fired.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: If you're a vice president, the difference between--", 
    "DANNY BURKES: I mean, I don't know if he quit or was fired.", 
    "But I doubt it was actually because of anything that you've", 
    "read or that I know.", 
    "There's a whole story there that nobody will ever know.", 
    "And he took is $5 million and went off somewhere.", 
    "It's hard to feel a lot of sympathy for that guy, right?", 
    "Anything else?", 
    "STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "DANNY BURKES: There are other consultancies that focus", 
    "on start-ups, certainly.", 
    "I'm personally familiar with ones in San Francisco just because we run in", 
    "the same circles.", 
    "There are fewer consultancies that do things the way we do.", 
    "XP-based consultancies is a small set.", 
    "And then start-up focused consultancies is a small set.", 
    "The overlap is really small.", 
    "I could probably count on one hand those.", 
    "But we're friendly with those people.", 
    "And we refer business out to them when we just don't have capacity.", 
    "It's a small community.", 
    "And more than one of those are founded by people who used to work at Pivotal.", 
    "We're pretty close, even though we're competitors.", 
    "But there's enough business to go around, definitely, right now.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: Is it a lack of--", 
    "I would think one of the attractions of software development is when you", 
    "work for a company like an Apple where you built this software, everybody in", 
    "the world knows about it.", 
    "So do you not get that satisfaction after a while?", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Well, it's a different satisfaction.", 
    "I mean, certainly we've had clients where we have developed web apps or", 
    "mobile apps that are very, very successful and are in the hands and", 
    "are used by millions of people.", 
    "That side of the success story is definitely there.", 
    "You can develop very significant software at Pivotal.", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: [INAUDIBLE]", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Yes, but you don't own it.", 
    "There is this distinction.", 
    "You're not actually part of the company.", 
    "That bothers some people.", 
    "People come to work for Pivotal for a few years, and then some people say, I", 
    "really want to own something.", 
    "I really want to go work for a product company.", 
    "That happens.", 
    "Being a consultant, you don't have that ownership.", 
    "Some people like that.", 
    "Some people don't.", 
    "Any other questions?", 
    "DAVID PATTERSON: All right, great.", 
    "Thanks a lot.", 
    "DANNY BURKES: Thank you.",
