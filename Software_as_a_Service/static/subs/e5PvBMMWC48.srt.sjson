    "So let's talk about Ajax for a second.", 
    "So, you guys have done a little bit of Ajax, right?", 
    "Some nods, right?", 
    "Thumbs up?", 
    "Thank you.", 
    "Simple cases.", 
    "So did you know where Ajax comes from?", 
    "Did you talk about the history?", 
    "Right.", 
    "Outlook for the web.", 
    "This was back--", 
    "specifically, Outlook for the web is where Ajax came from.", 
    "This is Microsoft saying, how can we get people to use Outlook but not have", 
    "to pay for additional licenses so that they will come and", 
    "buy additional licenses.", 
    "They said, we're going to have Internet Explorer do webmail.", 
    "Now, none of us could live without webmail today, but in 1997, '98, this", 
    "was insane that you would do this.", 
    "And had we actually had to extend the browser API in order to make Ajax", 
    "calls, right, asynchronous JavaScript and XML.", 
    "We'll drop the XML in a little bit.", 
    "But this is why Ajax exists, so that we could do things like click on those", 
    "little blue buttons on the left and change the content on the right.", 
    "Amazing, right?", 
    "This is blowing people's minds 15 years ago.", 
    "But it's really not doing that much different than what you already know.", 
    "Because all we've done is created this new object, called an XML HTTP", 
    "request, which I will now say XHR.", 
    "And we're going to set up some things on it--", 
    "give it an HTTP verb, give it a URL, say that true means we do want it to", 
    "be asynchronous.", 
    "This very obvious thing called onreadystatechange, which is a", 
    "function that we're going to do some switching on the ready state when we", 
    "get called, and then we're going to send it to go off into the ether.", 
    "And this is no different than what you're dealing with on", 
    "the page right now.", 
    "So let's go back a little bit to the static page.", 
    "You've got this static HTML page.", 
    "Only interactivity a user's going to have on that is clicking on links and", 
    "maybe submitting a form.", 
    "Right?", 
    "And those are all going to go into URLs, go out to your server, come", 
    "back, maybe they'll go to another server, they leave your page because", 
    "your content isn't compelling enough.", 
    "But Ajax basically says you can do all that same interaction with the server", 
    "that the user could do, but in the background from your JavaScript.", 
    "And oh, by the way, do the exact same stuff that you were doing.", 
    "We can do gets, puts, posts, deletes, whatever.", 
    "Take the results that come back from the server, and show that to the user.", 
    "But do it on the same page.", 
    "Right.", 
    "We never left Outlook, right.", 
    "We were still in our mail.", 
    "Project forward and just think about Gmail today, same stuff, right?", 
    "Your URL bar will never change, and yet, what is happening is, we're going", 
    "off and doing that same process, your Rails app, and I'll show you some", 
    "controller code in a little bit.", 
    "But your server is really not doing anything that different other than,", 
    "there's going to be an additional header that says, oh hey, this is an", 
    "Ajax request, and maybe your server is going to decide that it's going to", 
    "deal with that a little differently and only send down maybe HTML", 
    "fragments or something else, which we'll talk about in a little bit.", 
    "So again, not that different.", 
    "But to the end user, you've got a really drastic, different situation.", 
    "So back to our white board here.", 
    "Let's say that what we've got is in our JS on the bottom of our page, that", 
    "we've got these nodes in the static HTML.", 
    "And by some interaction, some listening to some events, some firing", 
    "off and hitting our server, I can now change those, right.", 
    "Whoopee.", 
    "Move some stuff around, put some new content on the page.", 
    "But again, the URL isn't changing, and we're still in that same document.", 
    "Pretty straightforward stuff.", 
    "But that's what Ajax gives you.", 
    "So now, we've got even more interesting interaction.", 
    "We all use Twitter.", 
    "Presumably, we all use Twitter.", 
    "Right.", 
    "Twitter is an app, right?", 
    "We can sit here and scroll all day long, because I'm on Wi-Fi.", 
    "Right.", 
    "And a page event is happening, and Twitter is going into more tweets in", 
    "the background.", 
    "That's not that exciting, but it's Ajax.", 
    "Have you guys seen this?", 
    "I'm really not trying to be political, but the New York Times Skimmer app,", 
    "which I'm sure will come up a little bit later.", 
    "We'll talk more about the history of some of their front-end frameworks.", 
    "The New York Times Skimmer app, which is at nytimes.com/skimmer, or it's at", 
    "/chrome, either one.", 
    "As long as you're in a WebKit browser, Safari or Chrome, you get this", 
    "awesome, very fresh, doesn't-look-lik e-the-paper-page view of", 
    "the New York Times.", 
    "We could even get down in here and it gets crazy into we can change our", 
    "layout with different CSS.", 
    "Right.", 
    "This is pretty nuts, right?", 
    "This is all Ajax.", 
    "Now, if we looked at the URLs, there are some fun here with hashes, and", 
    "somebody will ask about that, and we talked about that.", 
    "Basically, the front-end is never going to pay attention to anything", 
    "after the octothorpe there.", 
    "But we get some neat interactivity in a way that maybe", 
    "we didn't have before.", 
    "And it certainly is a little more interesting.", 
    "I, by far, enjoy hitting the New York Times with this app way more than I", 
    "do-- oops, I said app--", 
    "than before.", 
    "This actually just got launched about three days ago, and I wanted to show", 
    "it to you guys.", 
    "This is ESPN getting into the mix.", 
    "Pretty crazy.", 
    "Scrolly panes.", 
    "Show me the articles.", 
    "Again, this is all HTML and JavaScript.", 
    "Go look at these pages; you'll have a lot of fun with it.", 
    "You'll see a lot of horrible JavaScript, probably a lot of minified", 
    "JavaScript.", 
    "But the neat thing about this--", 
    "if you guys want to talk about mobile later, if that comes up--", 
    "is that this page-- if you bring it up on a phone, an Android", 
    "phone or an iOS phone--", 
    "it does the paned thing.", 
    "So instead of having this awesome, iPad-like view, these stack on top of", 
    "each other and swipe away.", 
    "Really, really slick.", 
    "And it handles touch events, too.", 
    "Pretty spectacular stuff.", 
    "Anyway.", 
    "So what do we have going on here?", 
    "Basically, we've taken the static document, which is boring, and the", 
    "first thing that we all do, we've added maybe some fun interactive", 
    "things, maybe, yes, jumping buttons, little animations, right.", 
    "But then you started getting into, and Armando showed me one of the screen", 
    "casts for the Rotten Potatoes app.", 
    "Right.", 
    "And then it also gives you snappier UI response, right.", 
    "You can show and hide things really quickly.", 
    "You can have data sitting on your page that's sort of hiding until the user", 
    "actually wants it.", 
    "There are all sorts of good reasons for user experience why", 
    "you want to do that.", 
    "But now, the phrase that you're starting to hear is--", 
    "single page apps.", 
    "Right.", 
    "Were you guys hearing that at all?", 
    "Out in the--", 
    "Eh, OK.", 
    "Basically, what you're seeing with the New York Times app and the ESPN app--", 
    "it's the future.", 
    "But it's what a lot of people are coming and paying us at Pivotal to do,", 
    "which is we don't want to write native code for all these different", 
    "platforms-- we don't care about Windows versus Mac, maybe we don't", 
    "care to have different versions of mobile.", 
    "What we want to do is we have a website or we have this data that is", 
    "very easily consumable by a website.", 
    "And we want to turn this into something really interactive, right.", 
    "And it turns out that this is enough fun, and there are enough people in", 
    "the open source community playing with it, that the industry is definitely", 
    "going this way.", 
    "There are all sorts of fun tensions between native apps on mobile and", 
    "desktop web stuff.", 
    "That's not important.", 
    "What's important is that you can do that with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.", 
    "And it's only getting easier and easier to do that.", 
    "ESPN's an example.", 
    "Literally, I think that was shipped on the 25th of last month.", 
    "And I found it last night when I was poking around, looking for better", 
    "examples for you guys.", 
    "But we've gone from that static all the way to this", 
    "really interactive thing.", 
    "And we've made users happier in the process.", 
    "But we have to learn JavaScript in order to do it.", 
    "We have to learn the DOM API in order to do it.", 
    "And that's where the challenges come in."
