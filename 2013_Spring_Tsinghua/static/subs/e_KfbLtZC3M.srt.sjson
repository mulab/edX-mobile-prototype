    "DAN KLEIN: Lets talk a little about what", 
    "we can do in robotics.", 
    "We cannot, yet, send them through time.", 
    "But we can, maybe, do more than you may think.", 
    "So, what is robotics?", 
    "Well to actually build robotics, there's a lot of,", 
    "say, mechanical engineering.", 
    "The mechatronics, building the gears, and sorting out the", 
    "forces and soldering things.", 
    "That's all very important, but it's not really what we do in", 
    "this class.", 
    "In this class, we look at the part of robotics, which is AI.", 
    "And that's the control of the robots.", 
    "Figuring out, once you've got this robotic platform, what", 
    "control signals do you send down the wire to do whatever", 
    "you're trying to do.", 
    "Pick up the cup, or sweep the floor or whatever it is.", 
    "It turns out that simulating robots is much easier than", 
    "actually deploying robots.", 
    "We alluded to this earlier, where once you're in the real", 
    "world, suddenly it's not just planning for how", 
    "you move that arm.", 
    "But it's acknowledging that maybe your sensors are a", 
    "little bit wrong.", 
    "Or maybe the arm will slip during motion.", 
    "And everything is much, much harder in reality than in", 
    "simulations.", 
    "Also, when you mess up it's more expensive in reality than", 
    "in simulations.", 
    "These robots do not come cheap.", 
    "What kinds of things can we build?", 
    "We can build autonomous vehicles.", 
    "We'll talk about a couple kinds in this course.", 
    "We can build rescue technologies.", 
    "We can build soccer playing robots, which is, of course, a", 
    "critical goal of AI.", 
    "And we can automate a bunch of stuff.", 
    "I mean, in some senses, robots are all over, right?", 
    "Your dishwasher's a robot for cleaning dishes.", 
    "It's just, to a first approximation, you blast water", 
    "at them and now they're clean.", 
    "And so we'd often don't think of that as much an AI task.", 
    "But there are control problems, even in a", 
    "dishwasher.", 
    "In this class, we're going to ignore the mechanical and", 
    "mechatronic aspects of robotics.", 
    "And we're only going to think about the planning and the", 
    "control aspects.", 
    "Let me show you, for today, a kind of sense of what kinds of", 
    "things you can do.", 
    "So, I love this.", 
    "Does anybody know what this is?", 
    "This is RoboCup.", 
    "This is the AIBO league.", 
    "They're so cute.", 
    "OK, I'm going to play a little bit of an AIBO soccer match.", 
    "The first thing to notice is that they're in formation.", 
    "They're going to play soccer.", 
    "It's a team thing.", 
    "They have to coordinate.", 
    "Right.", 
    "It's kind of like watching five year olds", 
    "play soccer, right?", 
    "Like the white goalie, what are you doing?", 
    "What are you doing?", 
    "Fortunately, you don't actually need a goalie when", 
    "you're playing against these guys.", 
    "Goal, right.", 
    "So, what to learn from here?", 
    "First of all, multiple agents are harder to", 
    "control than one.", 
    "It's actually hard to do much with an AIBO, right?", 
    "But multiple agents are harder control.", 
    "You've got to coordinate.", 
    "There's this level of multi-agent control.", 
    "You also have to get the individual robot to simply", 
    "walk along and find where the ball is.", 
    "Do the vision and the calibration.", 
    "All of that stuff is hard.", 
    "Even when you're not thinking about soccer strategy.", 
    "Right.", 
    "So this is an example of that.", 
    "Something else I'd like to use these AIBOs to show, is that", 
    "remember we talked about the difference between an AI", 
    "acting in an optimal way, versus in a biomimetic, kind", 
    "of, human like or in this case dog like way.", 
    "It turns out, when you're playing soccer a dog might", 
    "move a ball a certain way.", 
    "But if you got an AIBO, you don't want to move the ball", 
    "like a dog.", 
    "You want to move the ball in the best WAY possible.", 
    "And you'll never guess what it is.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "And then you got to turn around and see", 
    "what the heck happened.", 
    "So they're all going to go over to the ball now.", 
    "So, again, the point here is optimal.", 
    "Sometimes you kick it the other way.", 
    "Not biomimetic.", 
    "We talked about autonomous cars.", 
    "So here are some footage from a Google autonomous car.", 
    "And you'll notice it may no be Telegraph Avenue, but these", 
    "things are kind of around you driving.", 
    "And the cool thing is, you probably don't even know it.", 
    "Sometimes you look over into the next car and the robot", 
    "waves back.", 
    "But barring that, you may just not even know.", 
    "But fully autonomous driving.", 
    "This is showing some of the sensors that are available.", 
    "I don't know.", 
    "My palms sweat watching this driving, even", 
    "with a driver there.", 
    "So autonomous driving, better than you might think.", 
    "Let me show you.", 
    "We talked about towel folding.", 
    "So let me show you a bit of towel folding from Pieter", 
    "Abbeel's lab.", 
    "This is the PR2 folding towels.", 
    "It turns out, when you're a robot, the hard part about", 
    "folding is not the folding part but in the figuring out", 
    "where the corners are in the first place.", 
    "So you'll see the robot kind of twirls the towel until it", 
    "finds a corner.", 
    "And once it finds a corner, boom, boom, boom.", 
    "OK.", 
    "Well, it's sped up 200 times so not boom, boom, boom.", 
    "But boooom, boooom, boooom.", 
    "Right.", 
    "So it folds them.", 
    "It stacks them.", 
    "Beautiful, right?", 
    "[APPLAUSE]", 
    "SPEAKER 2: How do you get one?", 
    "DAN KLEIN: How do you get one?", 
    "I guess I'll have to check with Peter after class.", 
    "It is currently not the most cost", 
    "efficient way to fold towels.", 
    "Alright.", 
    "OK, now let me show you the bad boy here.", 
    "So this is a Boston Dynamics robot that is basically if", 
    "terminators had really, really tiny heads they'd look", 
    "something like this.", 
    "So let's see what this thing can do.", 
    "Right, it can pose.", 
    "Yeah, OK.", 
    "Great.", 
    "So, this robot, it has a big range of motion.", 
    "It can be stable doing these rotations, which is amazing.", 
    "People do it.", 
    "It can walk.", 
    "If I saw that walking towards me I", 
    "might be a little worried.", 
    "It can strike its pose and kneel down and do things.", 
    "It does push-ups in its spare time!", 
    "OK, you know when your robot does push-ups for fun you've", 
    "got a certain kind of robot.", 
    "OK, so, really amazing stuff.", 
    "So it may not be obvious from watching this, but it is", 
    "amazingly hard just to get a robot to walk.", 
    "That's why many robots have wheels, like an easier", 
    "platform of some kind.", 
    "To be able to walk like this, this is", 
    "amazing stuff they have."
