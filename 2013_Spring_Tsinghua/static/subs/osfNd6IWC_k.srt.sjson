    "DAN KLEIN: So we've just seen a short history of AI.", 
    "And now the question is, where are we now?", 
    "Well, let's let you vote.", 
    "We'll do a little quiz.", 
    "Which of the following things can we do at present?", 
    "Can we create a machine which plays a decent", 
    "game of table tennis?", 
    "Raise your hands if yes.", 
    "Yes.", 
    "Can we create a game that plays a", 
    "decent game of Jeopardy?", 
    "Yes.", 
    "Many of you saw this decent game.", 
    "It was OK, right?", 
    "The computer did OK.", 
    "We'll actually talk more about Watson later.", 
    "Can we build an AI that will drive safely along a curving", 
    "mountain road?", 
    "Yes.", 
    "Can we build an AI that will drive safely", 
    "along Telegraph Avenue?", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "DAN KLEIN: Yeah, I'm not sure I can drive safely along", 
    "Telegraph Avenue.", 
    "So the answer here is actually tricky.", 
    "We'll come back to autonomous driving a couple", 
    "times in this course.", 
    "I'm going to put a question mark here.", 
    "Telegraph Avenue is particularly difficult and we", 
    "can't just have a car which does", 
    "everything a human can do.", 
    "However, there are autonomous cars out there driving.", 
    "They are among us, and they have a plan.", 
    "Right, so in fact, we'll talk a little bit about, for", 
    "example, the Google autonomous driving cars, which under the", 
    "right circumstances, and with tools that a driver does not", 
    "have, are, in fact, able to drive on real roads.", 
    "Amazing progress.", 
    "One thing that's really cool about this list, I've been", 
    "using this list for years, and kind of every year or two,", 
    "some X turns into a question mark or a question mark turns", 
    "into a check.", 
    "It's really cool to watch.", 
    "Can we build an AI that will buy a week's worth of", 
    "groceries on the web?", 
    "Yeah, it's kind of almost not even AI, right?", 
    "Can we build an AI which will buy a week's worth of", 
    "groceries at the Berkeley Bowl?", 
    "That's a little harder, right?", 
    "You've got like navigate around, it's like", 
    "back-to-back carts.", 
    "This is probably something that we currently cannot do.", 
    "And this is an illustration of the decision problem, what do", 
    "I buy, being tangled up in the action in the real world,", 
    "which involves like not bumping into", 
    "people with your cart.", 
    "And to operate in the real world, in an actual mobile", 
    "platform, often mixes all this stuff together in a very", 
    "challenging way where the decisions you make happen at", 
    "multiple levels of abstraction.", 
    "Can we build an AI that will discover and prove a new", 
    "mathematical theorem?", 
    "Raise your hand if yes.", 
    "Raise your hand if no.", 
    "OK, so I'm going to put a question mark.", 
    "We can, in fact, build amazing theorem provers that can prove", 
    "new theorems.", 
    "Discovery, not so much.", 
    "Why is this hard?", 
    "So it turns out if I state a theorem and it's true, we can", 
    "build automated methods of proving that they are true", 
    "through computation.", 
    "It's a lot harder to just ask the computer tell me something", 
    "awesome about algebra I don't know, right?", 
    "Because it could be like, hey, wait, it I got it,", 
    "10 plus 3 is 13.", 
    "It's true.", 
    "But you don't know what's interesting.", 
    "So it's very hard to characterize what makes a", 
    "theorem interesting.", 
    "In some sense, it's easier to prove something that's true", 
    "than figure out what should be proven.", 
    "Can we build a AI that will converse successfully with", 
    "another person for an hour?", 
    "It depends a lot on the other person, right?", 
    "Some of you may have heard of ELIZA.", 
    "We'll talk a little about ELIZA when we talk about", 
    "natural language later in the course.", 
    "But, for most people, the answer is no.", 
    "For some people, the answer is yes.", 
    "You can converse with some of the people", 
    "for some of the time.", 
    "I don't know.", 
    "But the point is, in general, we cannot yet do this.", 
    "We cannot yet have computers that have full conversational", 
    "ability on any topic just like a human would.", 
    "How about can we build an AI that can", 
    "perform a surgical operation?", 
    "Who says yes?", 
    "OK, raise your hand if you would let an AI perform a", 
    "surgical operation on you.", 
    "Would you let an AI remove your kidney?", 
    "Where did all the hands go?", 
    "That illustrates one of the issues.", 
    "The answer here is a little complicated.", 
    "Yeah, we have computer-assisted surgery.", 
    "Computers are starting, including some cool in Pieter", 
    "Abbeel's group, starting to be able to tie knots in an", 
    "automatic way.", 
    "You can do things like track the movement of an eye in", 
    "surgery and things like that.", 
    "However, it is not yet the case, both in technology and", 
    "in cultural kind of willingness to undergo the", 
    "experiment, that we're going to be having computers swap", 
    "our kidneys around.", 
    "Can we build an AI that can put away the dishes and fold", 
    "the laundry?", 
    "Yeah, we can build it right here at Berkeley.", 
    "I'll show you a little bit later some of, again, Pieter's", 
    "work on folding.", 
    "We can do that.", 
    "Translate spoken Chinese into spoken English in real time?", 
    "Raise your hand if you think we can do it.", 
    "Yeah, we'll talk more about translation and real time", 
    "translation later.", 
    "But we can basically do this.", 
    "Now you say, wait, is it good English?", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "DAN KLEIN: I didn't say it was good, I said", 
    "it was spoken, right?", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "DAN KLEIN: But we can do a real to real time recognition,", 
    "translation, synthesis.", 
    "That is something we can do better than", 
    "you probably think.", 
    "Can we build an AI that will write an", 
    "intentionally funny story?", 
    "Who thinks yes?", 
    "I'm going to say no.", 
    "It's an open area of natural language processing.", 
    "All right, so you say, what the heck am I talking about?", 
    "What would it mean to have an unintentionally funny story?", 
    "Well, people did work on storytelling.", 
    "Why do we want to have AIs that tell stories?", 
    "Because we want to figure out what it means to communicate", 
    "kind of a coherent description of some sequence of events.", 
    "That would look like telling a story, right?", 
    "Describe what you saw.", 
    "And so people worked in the '80s, and they still work on,", 
    "though with very different techniques.", 
    "People worked in the '80s on taking a representation of the", 
    "world and turning into language through some", 
    "storytelling device.", 
    "A famous example this was the TALE-SPIN system of Shank.", 
    "And I'm going to show you some of its output.", 
    "And it's going to, I think, do a good job of illustrating why", 
    "this endeavor of logic-based, representation heavy AI, even", 
    "though people were trying and doing really clever stuff, why", 
    "it hit some walls.", 
    "So let's see some unintentionally funny stories.", 
    "I'll read them for you.", 
    "One day Joe Bear was hungry.", 
    "He asked his friend Irving Bird where some honey was.", 
    "Irving told him there was a beehive in the oak tree.", 
    "Joe walked to the oak tree.", 
    "He ate the beehive.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "DAN KLEIN: The end.", 
    "I can just see it, these kind of systems in the '80s trying", 
    "to describe this stuff to people and--", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "DAN KLEIN: And here's the important point", 
    "under all of this.", 
    "It is amazingly close.", 
    "It does so much right.", 
    "And it's funny because there's like one link missing.", 
    "So the bear is hungry.", 
    "He talks to somebody about where honey is because honey", 
    "will fix his hunger.", 
    "The friend replies there's this beehive,", 
    "it's in the oak tree.", 
    "That's a useful answer.", 
    "Irving could have said, I have a foot.", 
    "That wouldn't have been helpful.", 
    "Joe walks over because you can't eat unless you're there.", 
    "And then he eats the beehive.", 
    "It was so close.", 
    "And what went wrong was simply, in all of this", 
    "knowledge, was missing the factor that if you want what's", 
    "in the container, the honey, you have to first remove it", 
    "from the container and not simply eat the container.", 
    "One piece in a chain missing and the", 
    "whole chain falls apart.", 
    "This is why logical systems were too fragile.", 
    "And this is why people realized that uncertainty was", 
    "just a fact of life.", 
    "You're always going to be missing some piece.", 
    "OK, here's another unintentionally funny story.", 
    "Henry Squirrel was thirsty.", 
    "He walked over to the riverbank where his good", 
    "friend Bill Bird was sitting.", 
    "Henry slipped and fell in the river.", 
    "Gravity drowned.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "DAN KLEIN: The end.", 
    "Okay.", 
    "It's so close.", 
    "I guess it's kind of a weird story to begin with, even", 
    "without the gravity thing.", 
    "What went wrong here?", 
    "Well, it's, in fact, describing a rather", 
    "unfortunate squirrel drowning, right?", 
    "And what happened was there was a drowning event.", 
    "The squirrel was kind of the drownee, right?", 
    "That's what drowned.", 
    "And what caused the drowning?", 
    "Well, gravity.", 
    "Something's got to cause the drowning, right?", 
    "And in rendering this into language, the system had all", 
    "the information, but it didn't realize that for a drowning", 
    "event, it's really important that you say who drowned, and", 
    "it's not so important that you say kind of what force of", 
    "nature caused the drowning.", 
    "And so we were so close.", 
    "One little mess up.", 
    "The information was there and suddenly it's a funny story", 
    "rather than a demonstration of a successful", 
    "storytelling system.", 
    "I'll give you one more.", 
    "Once upon a time, there was a dishonest fox and a vain crow.", 
    "One day, the crow was sitting in his tree, holding a piece", 
    "of cheese is his mouth.", 
    "He noticed that he was holding a piece of cheese.", 
    "He became hungry, and swallowed the cheese.", 
    "The fox walked over to the crow.", 
    "The end.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "DAN KLEIN: I mean, what do I say?", 
    "There's no language problem here.", 
    "There's no like, physics violation.", 
    "It's just kind of weird.", 
    "It's like the foxes dishonest.", 
    "Why did you tell me that?", 
    "There's this whole digression about the piece of cheese.", 
    "This is a story about a fox walking over to a crow.", 
    "So it's a little weird.", 
    "And the failing here is not a failing of representing the", 
    "world, or of rendering it into language, it's a failing of", 
    "knowing what is worth saying in a context.", 
    "Right?", 
    "That's the same issue context again, very challenging.", 
    "There are so many ways for this to go wrong.", 
    "And we've had to deal with these things in building", 
    "modern systems.", 
    "Part of the way we've dealt with them is by changing our", 
    "tools, part of the way we've dealt with them is by changing", 
    "the way we formulate the problems, and part of the way", 
    "we've dealt with them is just by kind of making everything", 
    "robust in various ways.", 
    "OK, so you say, we can do better now.", 
    "Well, can we?", 
    "So what's this?", 
    "This is Siri.", 
    "And what happens when you tell Siri, tell me a story?", 
    "How does Siri do?", 
    "Once upon a time, no, it's too silly.", 
    "So at least we now know that the story is going to be silly", 
    "and do not try to say it.", 
    "So is that progress?", 
    "I don't know.", 
    "All right, so we are not yet to the point where we can tell", 
    "intentionally funny stories.", 
    "What can we do with language?", 
    "Well, I mentioned Siri.", 
    "Siri may not be the best at telling bedtime stories.", 
    "But Siri does some amazing things.", 
    "The pieces that make that up are used actually in many", 
    "places in industry.", 
    "There's automatic speech recognition, where you go from", 
    "speech to text.", 
    "There's text-to-speech synthesis, which is an easier", 
    "problem, where you go from the text to speech.", 
    "And then there's dialog systems that integrate all", 
    "this together, linguistic analysis.", 
    "Let me show you what a speech recognition system looks like,", 
    "just kind of when you point it at the TV.", 
    "So this is not customized to a specific speaker.", 
    "This is not over some great microphone, like how your", 
    "phones have really sophisticated microphones", 
    "these days.", 
    "This is just plugged straight into the TV and this is", 
    "essentially automatic transcription.", 
    "Let's see how well it does.", 
    "And in particular, watch the errors.", 
    "[VIDEO PLAYBACK]", 
    "[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]", 
    "DAN KLEIN: OK, so what's interesting about this?", 
    "First of all, is it good?", 
    "It is bad?", 
    "It does lot of stuff, right?", 
    "It does a lot of things right.", 
    "It makes some mistakes.", 
    "The mistakes are multiple kinds.", 
    "So for example, here, the classmates said", 
    "their final good buys.", 
    "That's like a good buys, like Best Buy, right?", 
    "That is exactly the sounds that the reporter said.", 
    "The failing here in this case was not in the acoustic", 
    "modeling, which tries to connect the wave forms to the", 
    "underlying linguistic sounds.", 
    "Here the failing is there are multiple things that sound the", 
    "same and you've got to figure out which one the reporter", 
    "could possibly mean in the context.", 
    "And this is a sad story, right?", 
    "Somebody died, people are not going shopping.", 
    "And we know this as humans.", 
    "But the system does not.", 
    "And so, in this case, it's a problem in the language model.", 
    "There are other cases in here where the problem is more in", 
    "the acoustics.", 
    "And putting all this stuff together in some probabilistic", 
    "framework that lets you reconcile it all, that's a big", 
    "part of how speech recognition works.", 
    "We'll have more discussion on that later.", 
    "We can do more with language then just manipulate the", 
    "signal from speech to text.", 
    "So this is actually my research area.", 
    "We can do things like question answering.", 
    "We talked a little bit about Watson.", 
    "And we'll have a lot more later in the", 
    "course about Watson.", 
    "So Watson is basically a question answering system.", 
    "Yeah, there's this layer of remembering to phrase it as a", 
    "question because you're on Jeopardy, and making sure you", 
    "wager the right amount on the Daily Double and", 
    "that kind of stuff.", 
    "But to a first approximation, a question comes in, Watson", 
    "kind of has to dig through a lot of information, like", 
    "largely Wikipedia, and connect up some answer to the", 
    "question, so that you know how to respond.", 
    "Basically, a question answering system, although an", 
    "amazingly cool demonstration of a very good one.", 
    "Another thing we can do is machine translation.", 
    "How many of you have used a tool like Google Translate?", 
    "So again, C-3PO.", 
    "How good is machine translation?", 
    "Well, it depends on the language pair.", 
    "If I'm looking at a page, say, in Chinese, and I don't speak", 
    "any Chinese, the machine translation is pretty good", 
    "because I was kind of starting with nothing.", 
    "But if I actually speak the language, maybe I'm better off", 
    "reading it its natural form.", 
    "You can see some of these problems if you do round trip", 
    "from, say, English to Chinese and back.", 
    "And you can see how good what comes back.", 
    "Actually, that's a good way to make an", 
    "unintentionally funny story.", 
    "What else can we do?", 
    "Things like web search really are about a lot of things.", 
    "It has something to do with the words, but also kind of", 
    "click stream information, and kind of local search, and", 
    "things like that.", 
    "And so there's a lot that goes into web search.", 
    "A big part of that is the language.", 
    "Text classification, spam filtering.", 
    "Again, spam filtering is a case where it's part language,", 
    "part not language.", 
    "We'll talk more about spam filtering late, and so on.", 
    "These are the kinds of things you can do in the domain of", 
    "natural language.", 
    "We're no longer trying so hard to tell", 
    "stories, funny or otherwise.", 
    "We're trying to build things like this.", 
    "And there has been a lot of traction.", 
    "There's a lot of stuff we can build.", 
    "We're not yet to C-3PO.", 
    "But we actually can now translate Russian, which we", 
    "couldn't do in the '50s, even though they thought we'd be", 
    "able to do it by the '60s.", 
    "But now, today, we can.", 
    "It only took something like 12 times longer than", 
    "they thought it would.", 
    "Other areas.", 
    "Another big subarea of artificial intelligence is", 
    "perceiving the world.", 
    "In large part, this is vision, but there's other kinds of", 
    "perception.", 
    "So things like object recognition, face recognition.", 
    "You probably have a lot of this technology", 
    "closer than you think.", 
    "You probably have face recognition", 
    "built into your cameras.", 
    "That's actually face detection, and not always face", 
    "recognition, though some cameras do that too.", 
    "Segmenting scenes into pieces, figuring out for a given image", 
    "kind of what it means, what's going on.", 
    "Here's an example on the left.", 
    "Here's an example on the left of an image.", 
    "And overlaid on the image is the machine's reconstruction", 
    "of the underlying 3D outline and mesh.", 
    "And you can see that reconstructed on the right.", 
    "This is from image.", 
    "But actually, it turns out that in addition to being able", 
    "to do a bunch of cool things in vision with the image, one", 
    "realization we've had in cases like autonomous driving and", 
    "vision is we don't have to use the tools that humans use.", 
    "We spent a long time with vision just trying to use like", 
    "a camera or two cameras slightly apart because that's", 
    "what we have.", 
    "We've got two cameras slightly apart.", 
    "But then we realized, we can do other stuff.", 
    "So what's this?", 
    "Anybody recognized this?", 
    "It's a Kinect.", 
    "The Kinect's got sensors that you don't.", 
    "Sorry, you didn't get a range finder, a depth detector, you", 
    "just didn't.", 
    "But we can build them, so why not?", 
    "And so now we can do cool things like take an image and", 
    "produce a depth map that isn't just about parallax, looking", 
    "at the distance between the two eyes, or about kind of", 
    "inferring from occlusion.", 
    "Because you'll notice people like to think that vision's", 
    "all about having two images.", 
    "But if you close your eyes, you can still see depth.", 
    "It's not like the world suddenly goes flat and you", 
    "shriek, right?", 
    "I mean, you close one eye, you still have a sense of depth.", 
    "We want to be able to have machines that do that.", 
    "But at the moment, we actually do pretty well by spotting", 
    "things like depth detectors because, why not?", 
    "OK, let's take a look at science fiction again.", 
    "Does anybody recognize this movie?", 
    "Does anybody know what this is going to be?", 
    "Yeah, this Terminator here.", 
    "And let's take a look at what it's like to be a terminator.", 
    "It's relevant to vision.", 
    "So here's what it's like to be a terminator.", 
    "It's actually a lot like being governor of California", 
    "apparently.", 
    "So it looks around.", 
    "OK, motorcycle, motorcycle, motorcycle, car, motorcycle,", 
    "someplace, target acquired.", 
    "So looking around, outlines, detection, identifying what", 
    "the objects are, figuring out what the target is.", 
    "OK, that's from the movies, right?", 
    "Just straight out of science fiction.", 
    "Let's look at some vision recognition systems.", 
    "This is a cute demo from Ali Rahimi's lab.", 
    "So here we have a camera panning around.", 
    "And we can do exactly the same thing, but for real.", 
    "So here we have the cat, cat, frog, fox, dalmatian. bulldog.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "DAN KLEIN: Terminate bulldog, right?", 
    "OK.", 
    "[LAUGHTER]", 
    "DAN KLEIN: This is a case where I think it's amazing how", 
    "close we can get to what people thought it might be", 
    "like if this technology were possible.", 
    "And this is today.", 
    "This is not robots from the future detecting", 
    "the bulldog, right?", 
    "This is today."
