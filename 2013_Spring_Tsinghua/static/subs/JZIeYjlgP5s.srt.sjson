    "ARMANDO FOX: Let's go through the answers, shall we?", 
    "Requirements drive implementation.", 
    "You already saw that with Cucumber.", 
    "That is certainly true.", 
    "We're going to see that it is also true when we're doing unit and", 
    "functional tests with RSpec, which we're going to do today.", 
    "Used only within Agile development.", 
    "They're used mostly within Agile development.", 
    "But that's only because other non-Agile processes haven't adopted", 
    "them as readily.", 
    "So they're absolutely used outside of Agile development.", 
    "This happens to be the environment in which BDD in TDD really took hold.", 
    "But you can use them within any kind of software process.", 
    "Basically, all it says is, we're going to write the tests first.", 
    "And we're going to let the behavior of the app drive the implementation.", 
    "We're going to let the test drive the code.", 
    "So B is not true.", 
    "That leaves us with C, which is that they embrace and deal with change.", 
    "And that's certainly true.", 
    "So if you voted for only A and C, you're correct.", 
    "So let's jump right in and get started with how to think about unit testing", 
    "and TDD, or Test-Driven Development.", 
    "You may also hear it called Test First Development.", 
    "There's a subtle nuance.", 
    "Test First Development strictly means you really write the test first,", 
    "before you write any code.", 
    "Test-Driven means that as long as you're writing the code pretty close", 
    "in time to the test, sometimes you get to cheat and write some code first.", 
    "So I'm going to present it from the purist point of view, doing Test First", 
    "Development.", 
    "In practice, there's a little bit of room for both, right, but just to set", 
    "the context.", 
    "So the first of many acronyms, get it, the first of many acronyms that you", 
    "can use to remember important properties of unit tests--", 
    "they should be fast.", 
    "They should be independent, repeatable, self-checking, and timely.", 
    "So what do these mean one at a time?", 
    "Fast means that it should be quick to run a subset of the test.", 
    "Because our whole process is going to be we're going to write a little bit", 
    "of tests and a little bit of code and switch back and forth all the time.", 
    "So when you write a new little piece of code, if it takes more than a", 
    "couple of seconds for the test that corresponds to that code to run, your", 
    "brain gets out of the groove that it's in.", 
    "And in section this week, hopefully, we'll be able to show you some power", 
    "tools that you can use to speed up and have tests running basically all the", 
    "time in the background while you're coding, right?", 
    "In the limit of this process, every time you save a file, there's a subset", 
    "of tests that are automatically run.", 
    "And immediately you'll know if you broke something.", 
    "Independent, again, because we're going to be using different subsets of", 
    "tests, that means that at any given point in time you're working on some", 
    "piece of code in your app, only a subset of the tests in your entire", 
    "test suite probably have anything to do that piece of code.", 
    "Therefore, it's important that you be able to run that subset without any", 
    "dependence on others, right?", 
    "If the only way for some tests to pass is for a bunch of other tests to run", 
    "ahead of it to set up some state, that breaks independence.", 
    "It makes it harder to run different subsets of tests in", 
    "whatever order you want.", 
    "Repeatable, well, you'd better hope so, right?", 
    "If you run the test N times, you get the same results.", 
    "Now you might say, well, what about functions that have some randomness", 
    "built into them and something like that?", 
    "Repeatable doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be", 
    "non-stochastic, right?", 
    "If you had, for example, a random number generator, you could write a", 
    "test that says something like 25 percent of the time, it should return", 
    "a number within this range.", 
    "And that's testable as a statistical, on a statistical basis.", 
    "But the test is still repeatable.", 
    "If you run it N times, you get the same result.", 
    "And of course, since part of our goal here is to automate as much of this as", 
    "possible, repeatable goes without saying, right?", 
    "With automation, if it's not repeatable, then it's a mess.", 
    "Self-checking--", 
    "for people who haven't done a lot of automated testing, this one is sort of", 
    "new, right?", 
    "The naive way that you think about testing a piece of software is that", 
    "you run a little piece of code.", 
    "That little piece of code calls a few methods, maybe in the", 
    "system under test.", 
    "You inspect the output.", 
    "And you go, yup, looks good to me.", 
    "Or you have your app running.", 
    "You make a request to it.", 
    "And a web page comes back.", 
    "And on that page, you're going to say, OK, that button looks good.", 
    "I saw this message, right?", 
    "That's manual testing.", 
    "And that means a human being is somehow involved in detecting if the", 
    "output is correct or not.", 
    "What we want is for the test itself to figure this out.", 
    "So we're going to look at a variety of ways, starting from the very simplest", 
    "ones, up to stimulating a web browser the same way that a human being would", 
    "so that the test can figure out all by itself if the right thing happened.", 
    "And timely just means that the tests are written about the", 
    "same time as the code.", 
    "And like I said, we're going to go with the purest version of Test First", 
    "Development.", 
    "So it's really timely, because the test is written before the code.", 
    "You can't get more timely than that.", 
    "We are going to be using RSpec, a domain-specific language for testing.", 
    "If you haven't heard of DSLs before, a DSL is just a small programming", 
    "language that makes a particular family of tasks really easy at the", 
    "expense of being general.", 
    "And we've actually already seen some examples in this class.", 
    "When we looked at migrations, migrations are written in Ruby.", 
    "But it's almost like a mini-language for describing how", 
    "you change the database.", 
    "We've seen examples of regular expressions, right?", 
    "A regular expression is like a mini-language for matching strings in", 
    "a certain way.", 
    "S-Q-L, or SQL, is a kind of DSL for making queries", 
    "against relational databases.", 
    "So you'll see a lot of little languages like this.", 
    "And in this case, RSpec is what we'll call an internal DSL, because it's", 
    "defined entirely in terms of another larger language-- in this case, Ruby.", 
    "We're going to use RSpec to write our tests.", 
    "They're called specs because they specify the behavior of the code or", 
    "specifications.", 
    "Correspondingly, there's a directory called spec.", 
    "That's where they live.", 
    "And as the book instructions explain, if you do rails generate rspec:", 
    "install, it'll create the right sub-directory structure where these", 
    "tests should live.", 
    "So where are they going to go?", 
    "They tend to mirror the structure we've already seen for your", 
    "application.", 
    "So where you have a model sub-directory and each file is the", 
    "code for one model, under spec, you'll have a model sub-directory.", 
    "And there's an underscore spec file for each model, right?", 
    "So movie.rb over here is going to have a movie_spec.rb, which is the tests", 
    "that go along with that class-- the ones that test that class.", 
    "Same with the controllers.", 
    "Now what about the views?", 
    "You can write view specs.", 
    "But what we've seen is when we're doing SaaS, the way most users", 
    "interact with it is through a browser.", 
    "We know that with Cucumber, we can use the Cucumber DSL to express things", 
    "about what the user sees when they get the view back.", 
    "So our recommendation is, for testing the views, you should", 
    "really be using Cucumber.", 
    "Because at that point, you're talking about what's the interaction as seen", 
    "by the end user, right?", 
    "It's an end-to-end test all the way out to the view.", 
    "So even though you can write view specs, we're not going to do that much", 
    "of it in this course.", 
    "At the point, where you're ready to test the view, you can use Cucumber to", 
    "check those assertions.", 
    "So let's jump right into an example of this.", 
    "And this is around the RottenPotatoes feature that we've already started the", 
    "discussion of, which is, we can add a movie by pulling info from TMDb,", 
    "instead of doing it manually.", 
    "So we had this example of a Cucumber story that says, when I fill in the", 
    "search terms with the name of some movie, and I press search TMDb, then a", 
    "bunch of stuff should happen, right?", 
    "So here's the line we're going to focus on.", 
    "What exactly happens when you press that button that's supposed to cause", 
    "RottenPotatoes to go out and search TMDb.", 
    "So if you go back to--", 
    "we had this idea of Rails Cookery, right?", 
    "When you want to add a new feature to your app--", 
    "and that's what we're doing here.", 
    "We're going to make this story step pass.", 
    "We have to have a new route, a new controller method,", 
    "and a new view, right?", 
    "Because when you click on something, remember the routes is what tells it", 
    "where the controller action is going to be located.", 
    "You need the actual code in the controller that reacts", 
    "to the user's activity.", 
    "And ultimately, you have to render something.", 
    "So you need a view, right?", 
    "So we're going to use this formula to write the code we wish we had.", 
    "This is a really important concept.", 
    "If you guys remember nothing else from today, remember the idea of the code", 
    "you wish you had.", 
    "Because this is the key to doing TDD, right?", 
    "So let's ask ourselves, if this controller method already existed, the", 
    "one that's going to handle the search TMDb action, what should that", 
    "controller method do in order to properly implement our action?", 
    "Well, if the action is to search TMDb for a movie and possibly add it, well,", 
    "one thing the controller method should certainly do is it should call some", 
    "method that does the search on TMDb.", 
    "And if it finds a match, it should have some kind of a view, like search", 
    "results, where it can show what those matches were.", 
    "And if it doesn't find a match, maybe it should redirect to the Home page", 
    "and show you a message saying TMDb doesn't have anything that matches", 
    "your movie.", 
    "So we'll deal with step three later.", 
    "It's the sad path.", 
    "We're going to work on the happy path, which is what happens when you call", 
    "it, and it finds a movie that matches, right?", 
    "Let's see how would we test that, if it already existed.", 
    "So let's hop over, OK, so hopping over to Pastebin, here's the first example", 
    "of RSpec that you can see.", 
    "And literally almost all I've done is I've translated the English language", 
    "sentences of the things that it should do.", 
    "Spec helper is just a file that contains some helper functions.", 
    "Whenever we write spec tests, this is pretty much always the first line of", 
    "every spec file.", 
    "This file is going to be movies controller spec.", 
    "And so what does describe say?", 
    "First of all, here is a set of tests that apply to movies controller.", 
    "And within movies controller, there's a lot of different controller actions.", 
    "So here's a set of tests that describe the action, searching for TMDb.", 
    "And we've got three requirements.", 
    "It should call the model method that performs TMDb search.", 
    "So notice I'm asserting that the method that we're going to call is", 
    "going to be in the movie model, right?", 
    "The model is where all the real work gets done.", 
    "So the controller, really all its job is to make sure that it hands off to", 
    "the right model method.", 
    "And we said it should select a new view.", 
    "In Rails parlance, it's called a template.", 
    "So it'll select the correct template for rendering.", 
    "And if the results had a match, then it should make those search results", 
    "available in that template.", 
    "All I've done so far is transcribe what we said we're going to do.", 
    "And I've got a terminal window over here that's running Autotest.", 
    "So what's Autotest?", 
    "Every time I save a file or change a test, it reruns all the tests that", 
    "might have been affected by that.", 
    "And it's just running in the background all the time.", 
    "So this is the way I code now.", 
    "Autotest is always running.", 
    "And whenever I'm changing the code, I'm immediately", 
    "seeing if I broke stuff.", 
    "We can see that the first time RSpec tried to run these three specs, here's", 
    "those three it clauses.", 
    "And they're all pending.", 
    "What does that mean?", 
    "They're pending because all I've said is what the tests are going to be.", 
    "But there's no actual code there yet, right?", 
    "Here's the it clause.", 
    "The it method is ultimately is going to take a block that implements each", 
    "one of these tests.", 
    "But for now, all I've done is write them down.", 
    "Why is this useful?", 
    "Because when I run RSpec and I see pending, pending, pending, they show", 
    "up in yellow.", 
    "It's a visual reminder that these are tests that I have to write.", 
    "I haven't written them yet.", 
    "That's why they're pending.", 
    "Let's ask a question first.", 
    "Before we go on to implement those tests, let's just do a sanity check.", 
    "The method that actually does the real work of contacting TMDb to search for", 
    "a movie, is that going to be a class method of the movie model, an instance", 
    "of the movie model, a controller method or a helper method?"
