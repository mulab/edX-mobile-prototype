  <p>
To submit your assignment, please submit a .tar.gz compressed archive file containing just your features directory. The command for doing this in a UNIX environment is:<br/>
<code>tar czf features.tar.gz features/ </code><br/><br/>
Please make sure that the features directory is contained in the archive. For example, unarchiving your submission should create a directory named <code>features/</code> in the current working directory. It should not extract all your features directly into the current working directory.
