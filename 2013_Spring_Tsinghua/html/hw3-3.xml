  <h2>Happy paths for sorting movies by title and by release date</h2>
  <p>Since the scenarios in <code>sort_movie_list.feature</code> involve sorting, you will need the
ability to have steps that test whether one movie appears before another in the output listing.
Create a step definition that matches a step such as "Then I should see 'Aladdin' before 'Amelie'."
</p>

      <i>Hints</i>
    </b>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>page</code> is the Capybara method that returns whatever came back from the app server.
<code>page.body</code> is the page's HTML body as one giant string.
  </li>
    <li>A regular expression could capture whether one string appears before another in a
larger string, though that's not the only possible strategy.
  </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Use the step definition you just created to complete the scenarios: sort
movies alphabetically and sort movies in increasing order of release date in
<code>sort_movie_list.feature</code>.
</p>
  <p><i>Success</i> is all steps of all scenarios in both feature files passing green.
