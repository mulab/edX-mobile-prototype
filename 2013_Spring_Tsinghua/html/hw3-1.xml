  <h2>Create a declarative scenario step for adding movies</h2>
  <p>As explained in Section 4.7 of Engineering Long-Lasting Software, the goal of BDD is to
express behavioral tasks rather than low-level operations.</p>
  <p>
The background step of all the scenarios in this homework requires that the movies database
contain some movies. Analogous to the explanation in Section 4.7, it would go against the goal
of BDD to do this by writing scenarios that spell out every interaction required to add a new
movie, since adding new movies is not what these scenarios are about.
</p>
  <p>Recall that the Given steps of a user story specify the initial state of the system; it doesn't
matter how the system got into that state. For part 1, therefore, you will create a step 
definition that will match the step, "Given the following movies exist" in the Background section of 
both <code>sort_movie_list.feature</code> and <code>filter_movie_list.feature</code>. (Later in the course, we
will show how to DRY out the repeated Background sections in the two feature files.)</p>
  <p>Add your code in the <code>movie_steps.rb</code> step definition file. You can just use ActiveRecord
calls to directly add movies to the database; it's OK to bypass the GUI associated with creating
new movies, since that's not what these scenarios are testing.
</p>
  <p><i>Success</i> is when all Background steps for the scenarios in <code>filter_movie_list.feature</code>
and <code>sort_movie_list.feature</code> are passing green.</p>
